You inspired me to clean my room today, sounds stupid but i've been depressed for 5 years now, lived in pure garbage land and today... I cleaned, threw away alot a shit and took a shower hahaha thank you!
You are my inspiration 
I will never understand how she has time to film her life so beautifully and create videos, incredible hard work in addition to what we already see
It took me a while to realize that this wasn't her first video, but it was the first one I saw, and I kept coming back because the shots and the music blend are almost fairy tale-like. Everyone should know and appreciate how much hard work went into this video, and I love every second of it.
Is there anything this girl can’t  do . Such a inspiration I learn so much from you thank you 
Im so happy to see 1 million and more likes on her video ️ im watching her videos when there was only 1k likes i found her video on YouTube after i randomly searched Chinese food , i was so glad i did...and always thought she must have to get a million and more for this precious videos 
This video is so simple, yet so beautiful. So calming. 
Also, dogs.
This is LITERALLY my favorite YouTube channel. ️️️ I notice that there’s purpose and knowledge in every notion that she does and I love it!
I have watched it many times. Very magical. She's like living in heaven.
I keep coming back on this video of her. I'm so glad she made this so far, I'm her top subscriber and I'm so proud for her. Its been a while since she post another video. Hope she come back sooner.
Oh my gosh, she's so amazing! The cooked food is above all excellent. Lots of goji berries and cakes she makes! If I were a man, I would do my best to win Liziqi's heart >3
I always use Liziqi as my inspiration for my videos!
I love Liziqi <3
Я восхищаюсь Вами, Прекрасная девушка! Вы волшебница необыкновенная! Дай Господь Вам здоровья, Вашей Бабушке. Вам огромного женского счастья! Я постоянно смотрю все Ваши выпуски, естественно подписана. Как хочется побывать в таком месте,  познакомиться с Вами, перенять для себя что-нибудь интересное. Живите долго и счастливо, Красавица 
seriously we need a disney princess inspired by liziqi.
This video is pure love harmony and the perfect definition of a healthy life
i really like watching your videos and as someone who’s really into cultural history and related topics it’s very nice to see traditional chinese methods that you use ! loads of love from bangladesh 🇧🇩
It makes me want to make snacks. It’s not so hard as imagined. Thank you, Li Ziqi. Hope you get back what you deserve for your contents, kick these greedy businessmen’ ass and come back soon.
LOVE from RUSSIA! Liziqi, thank you for all your videos!
Oh my God,how I feel so happy when Liziqi has answered all my questions on how they make many food such us, peanut , ,  kuaci...and many more.Of course I love all your video's.Your idea ,your perfect ..I always wonder ,to go to your hometown.....
This is heart warming, beautiful,  genuinely good wholesome life - thanks for reminding us how wonderfully simple like is - and some good hard work puts everything into perspective.  Love the edibles.  Thanks for sharing
Anyone else got the feeling of a magical story come to life straight out of a book or a movie or something? Some people want money, riches and stuff.... Others want what this beautiful girl has: family, love and appreciation of everything that surrounds her. Not to mention the gorgeous way the 2 little dogs and the sheep that are following her everywhere ️. I love everything about what I just saw: the love they have in this family, where they live, how organized they are... Everything! God bless you all ️
This Woman knows everything. Huge respect for keeping Nature close at hand. You are a beautiful being 
If I can live with here, my age probably be over 100 years! I love the nature around her  home... Especially the natural and fresh foods. Good luck for you!
It was quite sometime when I realize that thid wasn’t her first video but this was the first one I saw and I keep coming back. The shots and the blend pf the music is almost fairy tale like. Everyone should know and appreciate how much hard work went into this video and I love every second and minute of it.
Adora os vídeos 🇧🇷️
These videos are very useful for those who want peace of mind.It feels so happy and peaceful to see this way of life.The pleasure of living in harmony with nature is something else.🇮🇳
She is my inspiration for my videos! Creating videos on YT is a way for me to save beautiful moments with my mom. 
Liziqi cooks really well, I love everything in her video. If anyone used to make videos on YT like her, you will know how hard she did during the 10 minutes of this video.
Wish we can watch more videos from her, I read some news on the internet about her recently.

But I hope she can back.
She's like a Disney princess.. but better because she can do anything
Me encantan los vídeos de esta chica, los encuentro demasiado relajantes 
Just love watching her videos . So inspiring .
I’d love to have a area to have the access to fruit/veggies and vegetation that she does.  Gardening brings me such joy.

Her life is so productive while me laying at bed all day because of quarantine and watch her vids.
I am still baffled how citrus fruits can grow there when they actually have cold winters. If that's the case, why can't these fruits grow in Tennessee, USA bc it's something I want to plant lol.
Minuto 6:00, me hizo reír. Litzi le tapa los oídos a la abuela, pero ella y’a debe ser sorda. Gracias por tus videos cada tanto vengo aprender como viven algunos del pueblo de China
I just love how humble and happy your family lives. Many blessings to you and your family.

Wow liziqi your handcraft and your cooking dishes are so beautiful.
Could you share us the ingredients of your recipes, they are amazing, thank for sharing all the best of you
Her grandma is the most blessed grandmother in the world. I wish my granddaughter  would be happy to spend her time with me making me delicious food!:)
This sunflower seeds and peanuts not only look appetizing but also tastes amazing
Её блюда всегда выглядят по-настоящему аппетитно. В отличие от тех абстрактых инсталяций, которые водружают на тарелки в модных ресторанах.
The way how those animals just followed her. She looked like a princess on Disney or something.
this is beautiful just in the way like it’s so peaceful and fulfilling
Your dishes look absolutely wonderful! Enjoy watching you cook exotic foods. Ty for sharing!
I can't ignore this girl's hard working...huge applause for making feel us so easy to do everything. It was so satisfying 
Amo seus vídeos
Que lindo esses animaizinhos companheiros amor  puro muito lindo , que lugar mágico perfeito.
Her cooking and Jun's cooking has this same type of elegant and homey feeling to it. It just, makes me fall in love with cooking.
You inspire me،I'll keep watching you throughout my pregnancy.. Nothing's better than that.
When she ran to go cover her grandmother’s ear, that was the most caring and the most heart-warming  thing I have ever seen :’)
Much respect to a person who knows the meaning of life is in the family and friends in your life not money not gold or silver but love
Amazing lifestyle. Wish everyone can live like that. Connected closely to the nature and its beauty. Every aspect of this video is unique!
She is so great I like her cooking skills according to me she is more great than cheif....
The explosion  her anxiety reminds me of mine when I open a can of biscuits or even a bottle of champagne 
I Love Roasted Chestnut here in my country we usually have it during Christmas and New Years you just the holidays are already here when you smell roasted Chestnuts in the air.
Li Ziqi has a touching life story. She is an orphan raised by her grandma. After leaving her village at age 14, she tried many jobs, including waitress, DJ and bar singer. She return to her village in 2014 to take care of her aging grandma and started to make Vlogs to sell her farm products initially. Her Vlogs became an instant success in China.
I relly love this girl and her production team.
Hands down my most favourite channel ever! You are amazing!
really missed liziqi videos Hope she uploads soon in her channel
você tem uma abilidade impressionante com alimentos!  Deve ter muito conhecimento com medicina de raízes  e ervas
Спасибо! Талант и красота вместе гениальны! Любим всей семьей
She’s like a Disney princess with all the animals! I love her little lamb!
Thanking you for the beautiful nature based content. Just to say, in my newly released book, Re-imagining mathematics,  by Ashna Sen, I explore how the whole of mathematics can emerge from nature,  the arts and even community...exactly what you do!
She is beyond perfection  How beautiful omg this video healed my mind
Wow... this video was posted 3 years ago... right around Chinese new year. I certainly miss the days when we can have festive celebration without worry and mask.
This video I probably think I watched it more than 20 times and it is my most favorite video.
Большое спасибо за русские субтитры 
The way the little animals follow her around... shes already a princess 
The snack looks so tasty
The video is so wonderful
Smart and talented lady

Mi respeto y admiración, joven, bella y muy trabajadora y amorosa con su madre o abuela no sé, pero es muy lindo todo
The puppies and the sheep following her around and sitting next to her while she worked.... That was so cute.
She's a Disney Princess y'all.
I love her for understanding the world's true beauty. She is beautiful both on the outside and the inside
またまた日本語字幕が増えてる！嬉しいです！
今日仕事帰りに見かけた中国の山査子と砂糖のお菓子、迷ってやめたけど買ってくればよかった…！

Suddenly I felt like I wanted to be better... Her video made me think over and over about what I'm doing with my life... She made me love life.. Thanks to her.
This girl is amazing, I wish I could live like her
El vídeo más relajante que he podido ver
Можно бесконечно смотреть как человек трудится особенно в такой красоте . Но пора уже и отдыхать , трудолюбие просто зашкаливает , или еще недостаточно заработала...
Every time I watch your video it always comes up to my mind to take action of my life and not just lying in bed.
I just found your channel today and absolutely love it!! I love the editing, music, quiet/gentleness to your videos. Your environment is amazing! You live a very blessed life. I wish I could live with you, be your sister and learn everything I could from you!
Que vida tan bonita consumir y preparar todo lo que siembras, plantas y cosechas así quiero vivir.
100M views for this video! That is Amazing and not to mention that I probably contributed 1K views to this myself ️ this is a Fantastic video and that beef looks so damn mouth watering 
I love the season you're in I wish one day I will come
I admire him, he can cook, make crafts from wood, etc., the spirit continues for you
She is living very aesthetic life
Her channel is the purest thing I've ever come across on YouTube.
Liziqi, Kamu adalah perempuan yang hebat  dan bertalenta 
Çok güzel doğal ortam bayılıyorum videolarına ️
The animals following her is exactly how I want animals following me 
Hermosos animales y tu excelente Ben video excelente trabajo 
This Woman knows everything. Huge respect for keeping Nature close at hand. You are a beautiful being 
The cinematography, the content, the editing skills. This is the most perfect video in youtube.
How can someone's life be so perfect? I mean they basically dont need to spend money on anything. I pray for this. Eating natural food is life itself.
If only people would realize that this kind of life is better than living in luxury
Thật tuyệt vời, tôi có thể xem nhiều video của bạn nhưng không chán, cảm thấy tâm hồn mình được thư giản. Cuộc sống này yên bình làm sao.
It'll break Her Heart When Grandma Leaves! But I wish Her Long Live Liziqi  Lots of Love from Nagaland 
liziqi vlog 
Such an inspiration to many
Missing u and ur vlogs
From Philippines here so proud 
Ur one of the best
Восхищаюсь вами и вашей природой.
I love this movie bgm and way of cooking style, atmosphere, circumstances all of them. If heaven exist on the earth, I will choose this town without hesitate.
she was more scared than granny by the popcorn machine release but still covered her granny's ear instead of her own xD cute
2021年9月20日      This is more of a real life recording than staging.    Incredible genius and artist .  

Of course now Ziqi can afford any kind of “staging “ .   But she does not need it.   

Her cost of making each video is almost neglect-able relative to the money she is getting out of it.   

Talking about the art of making money?   Ziqi is indeed a genius of making both US Dollars as well as RMB.   She did not intend it though.   To her,  it has been a big surprise I guess.    

Ziqi deserves everything.   She earned it all.   

Leave her alone!!!!  I mean everyone!!!  Let her just create more videos.    That’s the best way for her to serve this world,  serve Humanity.  

Government involvement of any kind will only destroy this beauty.  

The beauty of the digital world.  

A real person in life.   A loving granddaughter.  A real “People’s Artist “and, an amazingly hard worker 
My dream is to visit China and all its regions... I really love China with its culture and language and I adore its people... Congratulations to me... I have been studying Chinese for a year
Estos tipos de vídeos son tan relajantes.
Kiến thức ẩm thực rất phong phú , mình đã ở Quảng Đông 3 năm ,chúc em mạnh khỏe ra nhiều videos chất lượng
Everything she cook looks so yum and aestetic
Am I the only one questioning who took these awesome footages of her doing this stuff?
It's so calm there. And its very funny moment when you and the dogs were instantly screaming when the popcorn bomb
Saya dari Indonesia suka sekali menonton video ini, penggemar Liziqi di Indonesia juga banyak bahkan telah terinspirasi setelah menonton ini.
This girl made my day 
Que hermoso todo lo que se ve y ella una genia, quisiera estt ahi para probar todo lo que ella hace jajajjajaja
Yaşamak istediğim hayat, olmak istediğim yer, tatmak istediğim yemekler... ️
Her videos came to my attention by my 10-year-old daughter, she loved watching her videos on YouTube. Now we are watching it together and we both are fascinated and awe-inspiring by her works, we are learning Mandarin and this video will help us to know a little more about the traditional Chinese food etc.
Absolutely Amazing!!! This girl can do anything!!!
I love when the animals follow her around wherever she goes  they look so happy and excited
i always loved her cooking and of course her!
Her videos are so inspirational and beautiful
Her videos are well produced and absolutely gorgeous. But there is no way rural farm life can be so glamorous.
Lindas 
Very Nice! Bonito demais!
The way they make popcorn it's just amazing
Вот как так можно?  столько всего успевать? В любом случае респект и уважение девушке! Трудолюбивая 
Please make videos everyday  ......your videos was very amazing ...I loves it...please  make more

How easily everything available for them and that environment 
her life is amazing and simple even it's harsh but depending on yourself is great job
I don't know what it is about her videos, but they always make me cry. Tears of joy of course. Maybe it's because the videos are so beautiful I don't know what to do. How can I meet this chick?
Am so happy to see good people in this world and what a virtuous woman God bless her.

This is my favourite video of Chinesenew yr celebration...I watched it so many times ...
Gostaria de aprender suas receitas de infusão de ervas medicinais
I watched this 5 time I love the smooth video addition!
Amo alquimia culinária
China's food culture is extensive and profound. I love it.
She's so elegant and hardworking, and there I am, hungry but too lazy to get off the couch to get some snacks
The fun of this video is to do it yourself, combining the artistic conception of returning to the original nature of ancient Chinese traditional culture.️
OMG!!!Does she really exist in this world? 
Entertainment show.. I have always love to watch this girl video whenever my mind  told me to take rest.
Was just hanging out and watching this and realized we got English cations again️
Боже, как это восхитительно
I’m so glad YouTube suggested me this video! It’s for sure among the most beautiful videos I’ve ever watched. Everything is so carefully done and the editing is so sensible. I’m just in love with the channel. And the girl who cooks and does everything (haven’t found out her name yet) is precious. She looks like a green/forest fairy... Please keep doing this amazing job :)
Must be so delicious 
Muy lindo  el video me encanta la naturaleza, y la medolia que pone en este video me encanta  ,me relaja, gracias por estos hermosos videos, muchas bendiciones..
Inspirational videos for people all over the world. Human can do anything if he/she has the real spirit for it.

Seeing her makes me want to go to my village and live on my own...making small house ..gardening,farming
Faz tempo que eu vejo seus vídeos e são muito bons 
When uncle opened the corn popper Ziqi runs to cover grandma's ears, then jumps and screams herself.
This was so cute, how can I not smile and be happy
不管你回来与否，都谢谢你带来的快乐。愿你和婆婆安好！
こう言う暮らし結構憧れる
This is really so beautiful~
Those are so good!  I haven't eaten any of those things in years!
Your videos refresh my mind️
Her covering her grandma's ears instead of hers but being more scared than her grandma is so cute
My admire. Still watching all the video of liziqi. It's very deep and relaxing me. I hope 1 day i will do the same way like you. Am also from the countryside but invironment not support. Not easy to get the material.
Liziqi reaction is so funny within pop corn recipe 
Keşke İngilizce alt yazı olsaydı,ne konuştuğunuzu,yiyeceklere katılan malzemeleri öğrenirdik.
Really don't know how anyone could actively dislike her videos. 
5:12 saya tidak pernah melihat  pemandangan malam yang indah seperti itu,dan saya berterima kasih karena telah menemani saya selama 3 tahun ini liziqi.
Seems like she has a more fulfilling life that most of working to pay bills
Hol me gusta mucho tus recetas y también los postres pero me gusta mucho cuando ase las manzana con caramelo y también con todos los frutos secos los trozos de futas los cacahuetes y las pipas de girasol me gusta mucho muchas gracias sique asi con tus recetas felicidades soy de las islas canarias de lanzarote me llamo dominga un fuerte abrazo

Why isn't she uploading any videos I miss her 
Honestly what even is my life compared to this. Wtf. I've done nothing and learned nothing. And she's over here doing hundreds of different things in all these videos
最贴近自然的生活……没有你的视频都只能在记忆里寻找了
Liziqi made another video showing her making that baking kiln she is using for chestnuts and mangos. Liziqi can make most anything, she is so amazing.
Me gusta éso de hornear semillas o algo así.. en lugar de la borreguita ️
Amazing.. I've been watching this many times
Look at her cute lil entourage ️
I would love to visit and just be immersed into their everyday culture. These videos bring my soul so much peace and happiness.
She is so hard working thank you for giving me inspiration to almost everything  
I love your videos
The way she loves and cares for her grandma is so wonderful, this girl is a true treasure !️

How people disliked this Awesome Masterpiece  Video...?
どれもすごく美味しそうだし犬の形をしたかまどがかわいい！蓋を閉めると骨を咥えてるように見えるのが素敵
Satisfying to watch

Even her pets are perfect.
I miss her! She hasn’t posted any more new videos!!️
this is the Disney "princess" we've been missing.
Natura jest pełna niespodzianek. Warto je zrozumieć.
Come on! Who lives in a fairy tale land, had doggies and a lamb following her around? Super freaking cool! I love it!

Rice cracker pop and traditional pop corns!  Delicious!
Very lovely, very nice
The 61k people who dislike wanted to like but were so amazed by video they couldn’t look away and they misclick️
I come from the same place with you, Li ZiQi. Everytime I watch your videos, it reminds me of my childhood and my grandmother. We also lived in the small and  beautiful  village in Sichuan Province. My grandmother even has the same skills as you, she knows how to planting, cooking and making some useful tools. I'm so glad that you introduce our traditional rural lifestyle to the people all over the world. And let them know there are not only Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen in China, but also a land of abundance which last a unique lifestyle for more than thousand years, and named Sichuan, also the land of heaven in Chinese. But I can't back to Sichuan because of exams this year, and your video will accompany with me in the chinese new year. Support from a Chinese and Szechuanese in Italy. Happy Chinese New Year!!!!
第一次看就被吸引了，视频太有质量了!!!
When I see the negative video of smearing China, then I have to take a look at Ziqi's life to purify my mind️Life is so beautiful️
Que dulces más ricos haces se me pone la boca hecha agua
أحتاج هذي الحياة والهدوء والطبيعة والاشياء الحلوة ذي ️
Приветик, мои незнакомые друзья! Обожаю смотреть видео этой прекрасной девушки! Может кто то подскажет, что кроме муки и яиц добавлено в блинчики? Буду очень благодарна! 
The fact that she makes so much money off of these videos but still decides to live this life style. Respect.
大姐什么时候上传新视频

Superbbb , I just love it
看你的视频可以让我心静下来，忘记身体的劳累
好想看李子柒新年专辑，特别有年味
The ordinary people of the Chinese nation have been living like this for thousands of years. Manual work, farming economy, pure natural and pollution-free, until the advent of Western civilization changed everything. When the entire Chinese nation is like Li Ziqi, industrializing and informatizing the entire country with diligence and wisdom. And at the same time there is a higher pursuit of a higher and better future for mankind, such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Everything, and space technology. Li Ziqi's video appeared before our eyes like an angel's performance. When we (Western, Eastern...) stand in the reinforced concrete forest of the city, at the moment of the pandemic of the world. We fell in love with Li Ziqi's lifestyle. Li Ziqi never expected that she would be loved by so many audiences all over the world. This is a hint. At the crossroads of this turbulent world, where shall we go?
Missing u my Queen Liziqi. Hoping gor a new video.
when everything is so perfect it almost feels unreal and like a fantasy. Those people who think her labour is fake, i guess they're so used to getting dissapointment from life, that its unreal to them that one girl can be so amazing and live in a life that looks like a fantasy.
Oh my goodness she could be my identical twin sister I swear!
I wanna be like her.. Please, its so productive and she is so hard worker
This is life for me
Amazing️
️🇧🇷
I feel like crying while watching this video. It feels like she and I are are living in different worlds. This is the life I imagined but I'm already in a road that I have to give up on my dream life.
You are so talented ans cute
Why this much of dislikes... These are the most relaxing videos I have ever seen in YouTube.. love from India... Kerala
Аппетитно !
She is a princess and She work hard i love her hard works️️️️️️
日本語字幕がついてる……！！嬉しいです……！！！！
希望你能度过难关，快点回来吧，真的很想你
Love your video
Even a baby sheep follows her around... This really makes me rethink how I'm living.
田园生活，食为天，勤劳为乐，人间烟火，都活出了诗情画意了[赞]
喜歡下班看你的影片 療癒我在這個城市的疲勞
This is amazing.
OMG, EXACTLY WHAT I NEEDED ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- i got Free Gift Cards from  HOTLOVE.UNO 
She is great .  Proud of u
Every time I thought she was finished, she did like 8 more things...
Why do people give this a thumbs down? I don't understand the pettiness of some people.
These videos are little gems. I treasure each one and marvel at your life. You bring such joy to the tasks of your days, joy to your grandma and I hope and believe to the people around you. I have gained a whole different perspective of China from watching these glimpses into a way of being I had no concept of before.  Today I saw some humour in you, the little kick and jump from the loud bang, so cute. You are a blessing to this world.
Very nice and very hard work di️
无论以后怎样，愿你和婆婆安好！
I watched many video of her but this is very nice one
5:58 esas si son palomitas  explosivas
Pengen main kerumahnya, desanya Indah dan subur
So cute how the animals follows her at the beginning of this video.
I hope everyone gets this life not just this lady who earns a lot through her videos. If it is not for her, those dogs would appear in Chinese meat market 
Yên bình quá đi mất...nình rất thích 
私はあなたのビデオが好きで、中国の文化が大好きです。
這個才是真正的傳統炸爆米花️
Đồ ăn ngon đó

 Love, love, love it! 
You are a wonderful personality
見ていていつも思うけれど、これ、本当に現実世界の生活なんですよね。
余りに幻想的過ぎて、パラレルワールドの植物と共に生きている人々の生活を目の当たりにしているみたい。
I'm 17 seconds in and the puppies and the lamb following her like wtf how can this be so cute
Amazing hardwork.
Are we going to talk about how big those mangos were 

Edit: 3:09
Thích nhất líp này của lý tử thất nè coi xong líp này thích bả lun khéo léo tài giỏi quá chừng mấy cái đó mà cũng làm được phục bả lun

This video is very addictive！
For whom she is preparing,I can eat those in a glance and with my friends there could be scarecity in the village
5:56 she is SO sweet to her grandma it just completely melts my heart
童年的味觉记忆
好久没看你的新内容了……永远支持
Thích xem kênh của e quá. Nhìn giống như trong chuyện cổ tích vậy.
Видео действительно успокаиваетКыргызстандан салам
Все прекрасно, только я не пойму, почему у нее пёсики всегда такие голодные и не ухоженные? Такое впечатление, что никому до них нет дела и никто их специально не кормит.
Every time I’m watching her video , it reminds me how beautiful the world we leave in....️
Just picking nuts and fruits like that. Nature indeed abundantly provides if we do not destroy it.  Thanks LiziQi.
I'll prepare two Dairy Whipped Topping and Cinnamon sweet cane baked Corn Tortillas and a cup of sweet cane and green Apple Water mixed in Milk as early as I can after I fill the rest of my sweet cane and MELON Water in my other pitcher. I still have to shower, pick my hair, and put on what was produced to rub onto my body and DEODORANT.
simple dishes, simple but beautiful life
Your content is beautiful  If you can change and work in various places such as hair care
Happy New Year!
This is life should be. No war no drama no unnecessary pressure
Happy 100 M  I miss you so much
i love the popcorn part she's trying to cover her grandmas ears
Deep down,I know this is how life is actually supposed to be
Daming stock na pagkain galing galing mo naman magluto,sana ganyan din aq
You look like a Chinese princess and you follow traditional l love traditional so much ️
子柒，好久沒看到你的影片(只能看舊的回顧)，希望你能戰勝覬覦你頻道的人，讓我們再看到原本的子柒
I hope she will make new videos again
This is the kind of life that I want, thumbs up if want too 
I love that. So relaxing. But it takes away the magic that you can see, that this is not the grandma. This is a young person with too much clothing. Eh? Why?
Once upon a time...the was a legendary village far away from the hustle and bustle of cities and there was a princess who was even more gorgeous than ordinary girls who live in luxury...
Just remembering me and my dad seating and watching.
素敵な動画ありがとうございます。^_^
小さな頃、苦労されたと何かの記事で読みました。
でも今はこんな素敵な女性になりましたね。
お爺さま、お婆さまのお陰ですね。きっと。
いつも癒されております。
Enhorabona desde CATALUNYA
omg THAT'S how they made popcorn? that bit was so funny and this entire video is so wholesome
The oven was nice 
Тебе девочка всегда. Молодчина.
Her two dogs and baby lamb following her around is tooo cute
Ooohh God. Such a beautiful piece ️️ please tell me  which place is this??
你的视频是最好的️
5:23 When she called the Uncle selling popcorn, that was so precious. Reminds me of when I was in the province, whenever an ice cream or bread selling uncle pass by, I would shout loud to call them.
Обожаю эту китайскую женщину 
This is really high quality! 
I wonder if she has help with the animals. I want to see the dogs get fed! I know they're healthy and happy. They look beautiful!
Super...I love Watching your videos, lt is simple and just like movies... So cute puppies and lambs
Wish i was there to help you ️
THe music made this even more nostalgic and beautiful than it should be T_T
I thought mangos have seeds inside them 
The puppies and lamb following you are so cute. Such well behaved little cuties. 
Poor puppies got scared of the popcorn machine. So precious
I love puppies more than cooking 
Background music is awesome 
Teşekkürler bizimle de tarifleri paylaśin Yeni videoları bekleriz sizden
الله شكد حلوه 
كلمة مبدعة قليلة في حقك
She is so connected with nature like any human supposed to be. Sad that we totally lost our connection with nature and its raw energy. That's why we are angry and depressed in the cities.
you are a queen. you honor your elders
Wow so beautiful  love from  Bangladesh 🇧🇩
Wow  really amazing ️
Мне аж захотелось там жить на неделю
您的视频信息量更大。我喜欢
This girl is a perfect miracle... A hard past and now look at her... She’s living a happier life... She is my idol! 
Isnt this studio ghibli music? Everything about this is beautiful <3 ty
This video shows the most traditional way of Chinese making popcorns, oh dear lord, all my childhood memories. Ziqi, love you.
Even the view looks sweet.
那两只小狗太可爱了，还有小山羊 ，真是人间仙境
Yo soy el perrito peliento esperando a que se caiga algo para golosiar jijij. Que rico se ve
Dumnezeu sã te ocroteascã si sã-ti ocroteascã familia unitã mereu, Liziqi ️ Un 2022 sub protectia Domnului ️
Awww the pets are so cute and she is so pretty
Beautiful to watch the process, and encouraging. Life is harder but more valuable when we work with nature (Earth's bounty) instead of against it.
How melody these vdos are,  peaceful
Sakinlesmek, biraz karmaşadan uzak kalmak icin harika videolar.
She rolled the apple into sugar syrup,  it will given good taste,  if she peeled that fruit.
So relaxing
Neu co dieu uoc thi tui cung uoc duoc co cuoc song yen binh nhu ban, that la tuyet,...
This is my favourite video by Ziqi so far, it has such a comforting effect, reminds me of spending Chinese new year at home with my family.
Смотрела, не прочитав названия, только к концу поняла, что это сезон заготовок по-китайски. Не поняла только про блины, в смысле она их тоже убрала? Ну а большая посудина - это получается вок? Только огромный?
Despite all awesome things you do this, you do this for your pleasure or you have a business in organic food ?:D
Con gái mà giỏi quá kênh nhiêu súp thật ️
Now that's a way to make a living. Daebak I really wouldn't mind doing that, it looks fun.
Quá tuyệt vời!

Protect this person at all cost. She is an inspiration. My bad for discovering her channel at this time only. But binge-watching won't hurt anyway.
第一次看见这种视频1亿次观看加油
رااائع ماشاء الله
味道如何不知道，但百看不厭就係真！
我可以 重複不斷地 看 也不厭倦
I like it 
Patience, compassion and simplicity are the greatest treasure in man.

I cleaned up my room today. Organized my clothes. Thats a big deal. You are my inspiration! I think next week I might try canning!
অসাধারণ 
I don’t have anything to say  but she is incredibly hard working 
But the way : little puppies was really cute

Very cute pets 
Wow, you really live in the heaven! The heaven of fresh fruits! 
Ước j tôi đc ở đây

The picture quality is so good. Not to forget, this girl’s cooking and handicrafts skill is great too.
4년이 지난 지금 나는 이 소녀가 열심히 일한 결과를 이 비디오에 보여줍니다.

amazing 
For some reason I mistaken the chestnut as a dries sea "erchin" 
When I saw the hairy spikes
Hi  so hard working u r. Really inspiring...  I wish to do all these things WHT u r doing... but u know  m so lazy.   So give some tips to avoid laziness
When I get depressed by reading comments full of hatred about China I come here. This is like the most friendly place towards Chinese people. Thank you Liziqi. It has been a hard year to us.
Felt like i can spend eternity here
อยากกินจัง
I want this lyf..... ️
人與自然，人與人。
She could feed everyone in Burundi
I admire her work ethic.  I wouldnt be able to do anything without running my mouth or sweating.  The grease wouldve popped me while cooking and I'm a weenie so I'd be bitching about that.  My dog would be begging to be picked up, lambs hollering, just a country mess.
बहुत ही प्यारा सा अहसास <3<3 magical
The cameraman is just awesome
Ngon quá người đẹp ơi.
Such a hardworking girl....
Amazing  🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
This is the first YouTube's channel where I watched all the videos. you always amaze me !!!
突然現れた天使
When you can smell all the foods she cooks while watching. This girl is really really good at cooking.
كل شي ملهم ، احببتُ  هذا جدًا
هذا الفتاه محبوبه من قبل الجميع سبحان الله ومبدعه حتى شكلها طيوبه
она живет в райском саду ? там все есть, всё растет !
This great video! But sorry I have to say this, I got distracted to the BGM, it was used in Digimon Adventure OST OMGGG my childhood, the BGM fit perfectly X"))))
She is more accurate than calculator
The little lamb and puppies following her, I'm gonna cry 
3 bạn diễn viên quần chúng đáng yêu quá
Спасибо за перевод!
I wish she plant a durian tree and cook tempoyak patin fish soup
Мне бы такую жену)
I'm from sri Lanka super sister yummy 
*covers her grandma’s ears

Pop corn explodes

got scared and end up covering her own’s*

SO CUTE.
O drat, I know nothing about the Chinese Spring Festival but there are quite a lot of items mis named here sunflower seeds as pumpkin ? And all the foods harvested belong to Autumn so I suspect the lable is wrong. Nice to see toffee apples of both small and large varieties [ definately Not Hawthorn I do know my plants ] and chestnuts harvested and roasted all very similar to an old fashioned Celtic Samhain before the Americans comercialised it but without the Soul Cakes. Nice video amusing translation
Very beautiful place
Don't you ever give those puppies any treat when cooking?
I wanted to this when I grew up.  Thank you.
The best video about chinese food.
The melon seeds were sunflower seeds from a dried sunflower heart, I swear.
if my life isn’t like this, i don’t want it
This woman is very tough, I've seen her injured several times to create the world's best content.
keep up the spirit, Sister and hopefully have a long healthy life.
Warm greetings to grandma

You could dump this girl in the wilderness, and you'd come a year later to see that she already has a furnished house, eats nutritious meals, and has befriended and domesticated the animals xD

I love this channel so much.

SIXTY Years I have lived on this earth, and this beautiful human being has accumulated & demonstrated more wisdom and knowledge in her young years than I have in my entire lifetime.
I kneel before you humbled, Li Ziqi. You are amazing.

You are exactly what we should all aspire to be like. I wish you a long and wonderful life, and may the gods reward you and your generations to come.

ziqiLi are so surprising to us.

Lâu rồi tôi không thấy cô ấy đăng video mới.
Amazing that’s  how we used to buy pop corn or pop rice. I would bring corn or rice to a street vendor and he would make it using that machine. The moment when he opened the machine is so thrilling to a kid
Your animals are sooooo cute
