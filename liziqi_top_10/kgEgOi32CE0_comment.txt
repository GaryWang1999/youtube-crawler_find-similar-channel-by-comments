我再啰嗦一下，自酿酒蛮危险的。容器和操作不对气体排出不及时容易炸，坏酒也容易发生中毒事件。没酿酒基础的真不建议去自己弄哦。
One can't be too careful. Ziqi's gentle reminder：home brewing can be dangerous. Wrong containers or substandard oepration may produce excess gas, which leads to explosion. And your home brew can be infected and toxic too. Don't try it if you are not an expert.
Such a peaceful life
Сколько смотрю - столько восхищаюсь вами. Вы удивительная девушка: и вырастить и починить, вино и любое блюдо можете приготовить. Надеюсь болезни и беды обойдут вас стороной.
I made wine using your recipe.... It was very fantastic 😍😍😍😍... Thank you liziqi
The fact that Liziqi toasted and shared food with her camera person makes everything perfect!
You know, you learn a lot from this woman, from gardening to cooking to labor and the way she doesn't waste any food or plant. She finds ways to use the remaining by cooking or using it for fertilizer. Its amazing!

3:35 "grandma I finished it" this filled my heart with so much joy. She was so proud of it like a little kid who finally managed to ride the bike. It's so cute
Let us also give credit to the camera person or crew. Setting up all the angles, the time lapses and perhaps all the direction for the wonderful cinematography! Everything about this is quality!
You really inspire me to live the same village life again.  I used to live like this with my family at the farm where I was born and raised until I was pre-teen.  I miss this life so much.  Simple and sustainable.  I might do it again soon and film too.  Watching you always from the Philippines. +
Everything in her video looks so perfect. I love how she takes care of her garden and her grandma. Such a beautiful life.
I just love how they eat such a variety of herbs/spices, meats from every part of the animal, fruits/veggies, and whatever the earth plans to bless them with.  Nothing is wasted and everything is prepared to perfection.

The fact that she makes food out of everything shows how multi talent she is
Imagine this: she's been filming and working with all her heart for 7 months, and all those is compiled in a 20-minute video🙎
I'm speechless ( '  ' )
all I can say is I'm blessed to watch her at all.💗
You are so enchanting Liziqi, you really inspires me. How I wish to have the same hometown as yours to live like in a fairytale. You are so lucky to have a peaceful and very enchanting place. I really love your works and your garden and the way you take good care of your grandma is so adorable.
No salgo de mi asombro con esta dama, cuánto conocimiento de todos los ingredientes que tiene. A su alcance. Me relajo un montón viendo  sus videos  y me muero por saborearlos!!
在停更的日子里看旧视频，很难描述你的这些作品给我带来的感动，希望子柒幸福平安❤
Esse lugar é um paraíso! Morar aí é benção de Deus! Quanta fartura! alimentação saudável e ar puro!

She could be a princess, a model, an engineer, a chef, a gardener, and mother and a father at the same time. She surprised me. Mad respect for u queen. I respect u.
Tengo poco viendo estos videos, pero está mujer es increíblemente única , llena de virtudes , además amo la vida tan linda del campo ... Me encantaría aprender a utilizar todo de la naturaleza . 
Y me fascina la casa tan linda que tiene como decora todo y los utensilios tan sencillos pero muy utiles
Você é muito dedicada no que faz, continue a produzir esses excelentes vídeos.
Imagine living there getting to smell the fresh air instead of toxic waste and getting to eat whatever fruit or vegetable you want and walking around so peacefully without anyone bothering you.
tus videos son hermosos, a mi familia y a mi nos encantan y los disfrutamos muchisimo, muchas gracias por permitirnos disfrutarlo también
Как все вокруг красиво, живет как будто в райском саду. И конечно по традиции - Вы удивительная девушка: и вырастить и починить, вино и любое блюдо можете приготовить. Надеюсь болезни и беды обойдут вас стороной.
she literally makes food out of everything...this is soo calming.
Espero algún día pueda traducir los ingredientes en español, es un gran persona conocimiento sobre como mezclar ingredientes y hacer algo espectacular en la comida.
I dont have words to express my deep admiration for your channel. Please keep posting :)
This is the first time for me to know that watermelon peelings can be eaten, and it looks delicious 😋🤤
Unos de los canales más lindos de yuotube, ojalá este año tengamos videos nuevos :)
This girl is inspiring millions to return to the roots and live with the earth. She's a hero.

Gosto muito dos seus vídeos eles me inspirão !! Parabéns.
at the start of this year i was having debilitating panic attacks and would watch these videos to calm down. thank you very much for showing your videos to us all, youve definitely helped others like me find some peace during hard times

:") que hermoso es el vivir por ahí
there's something with liziqi's videos that feel like healing for me
I love how Liziqi and her grandmother treat themselves. It is really obvious how they love each other ❤️
Thank you for the English subtitles! They make your videos even more wonderful!
After she builds the arches, that little moment where she seems so proud of herself, that's my favorite moment of this video!
hoje em dia os jovens nem sabem como e bom viver da natureza.
Это как надо любить жизнь и природу , себя какая фантазия  божественная  ?
BOA NOITE LIZIQI GOSTO MUITO DE VER SEUS VÍDEOS VER VOCÊ COZINHAR ESSAS COMIDAS TUDO DELICIA MUITO BOM EXCELENTE DEUS ABENÇOA VOCÊ E SUA FAMÍLIA 🙏🙌🎄🎅🎄🎅💝💝
She can do everything by herself ! That's absolutely fantastic sis 🥺🥺❤️
Loved her lifestyle ,getting a peacefull vibe after watching her video ,love from india🇮🇳
I hope you know this not only helps my anxiety and depression but also inspires me to garden and take on tasks i wouldn't have before ♡
I can't explain how much I enjoyed this blog. Out of the world!!!! Thank you very much...
So cute.. You grow the most healthy looking and beautiful veggies, fruits and flowers.  You are surrounded by natural beauty.  Most all of your food looks amazing too.. Thank you for sharing

This is the most perfect personal video that I have ever seen , its so wonderful and valuable .I have learned much here ,like cooking ,growing and making the traditional meals  etc. so nice .
The fact that they invite the cameraman to the toast and to break bread with them describes how humble and human they really are. They are just amazing.
Alguien más siente que estos videos son adictivos? eso es por que nuestros receptores de nuestro cuerpo humano están alineados y diseñados para esto. Lástima que los medios de comunicación por todos lados nos metieron en la cabeza la comida industrializada. Pero tomemos conciencia de ello, tratemos de volver en lo que se pueda a nuestro origen, " La naturaleza"
The images her camera person is able to capture are so beautiful, what with the lighting and camera angles, they literally look like the works of a painter.  This video reminded me of something that was spoken by the female lead character Jin Mi, at the end of the last episode of Ashes of Love, where she says how she wishes to live her life in an ordinary manner, like dull clouds and flowing water. This lifestyle while dull, is also calming and peaceful, I really hope to achieve a semblance of this myself in the near to distant future. Peace is such a rare thing nowadays in modern society, the fact that you've been able to not only achieve it, but to also impart aspects of it to others is a very beautiful thing.

Amo ver esses vídeos tenho muito o que aprender
Ваши видео смотрю вечером, после работы. Они как медитация: успокаивают и вдохновляют!
Watching this video, I want to feel like traveling around the world to learn knowledge, plantations and enjoy the beauty of nature. Greetings from Indonesian farmers
I love when she makes something special like this and she tells the camera man to quit filming and get over there to eat already 💖💖💖
Que lindo! é tão bom ver ela fazer todas aquelas coisas.
Liziqi salvando uma brasileira estressada da cidade de SP. 
Obrigada Liziqi, obrigada.
I love seeing them all eat together! This video is so soothing
Adoro seus vídeos, uma comida deliciosa e exemplar, sem falar que os vídeos me tranquiliza depois de um dia puxado, parabéns. Brasil.
Hermoso video, como todos ! abrazo desde Argentina.
Hats off to the cameraman who shows to the world how amazing Liziqi is. Each is video is a lesson of humanity, it emphasizes how much we need and must respect Mother's Nature and the living.

I love this. This video is so calming and relaxing, and she is so incredibly talented and hard working. Absolutely beautiful aesthetics.

Just today I was thinking of her cotton cape video that I watched back in March, and I wanted to find her channel again, as I’m getting into gardening. I had subbed to her channel - but I couldn’t remember the channel name, and synchronistically this video popped up on my newsfeed. I’m going to make a point to watch her videos more regularly now as they are so calming and inspiring. Absolutely fantastic work.
Обожаю ее видеосюжеты и я восхищаюсь ею) Но, Лизи, собакам нельзя давать вареные кости. Сырые, да, но вареные кости опасны для их желудка, они становятся жесткими и острыми. При таком изобилии продуктов можно было бы и мяса немного дать. Я понимаю теперь, почему собаки у нее в видеороликах не одни и те же.
I adore how she gives the best pieces to her grandma. The sweetest fruit, the softest meat, the best piece of bread.
So peaceful and away from the noisy world...my mouth is watering now after watching this💕
I always love and feels inspired from all your daily posts May God give you more good health and long life 🌹🌹🌹❤️🙏
Boa sorte, que você recupere os direitos na sua marca e canal 🌸🙏🏻
wonderful video your sooo talented thank you for sharing this with everyone it was quite the educational video☺
This is absolutely Incredible!!  WOW - I wish I could do a replica of all of those things.
Even with all the crazy stuff that’s happen so far this year, You make the world seem a little less chaotic & more soothing, calming & gentle. 

Thank you!
Simplemente hermoso de ver. ❤️
Every shot is like a painting!The tones and images of the video are simply beautiful.
Seus vídeos são ótimos parabéns querida vc também é uma mulher muito linda 👏👏🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
Here in Canada we can ONLY “dream” of walking outside our doors and picking fresh fruit and vegetables (unless you live in the South, like near Toronto where is very hot and the winters are war,er and short), but here in Northern Ontario, we have to settle for “fresh…which very UnFRESH fruit and vegetable” by the time it gets delivered to us )….someday I will MAKE IT HAPPEN and buy myself a massive greenhouse where my kitchen door will lead to all that fresh splendour)
She is very talented making this by herself from cooking.chores. picking plants fruits planting and video editting is just amazing i want to meet her irl im from ph btw
English version of descriptions and what they said in this video:
0:02 - 2020 before "立春/start of spring" (1st Chinese solar term, in 2020 it's Feb. 4)
0:16 - watermelon seed
0:41 - "雨水/rainfall" (2nd solar term, Feb. 18)
2:03 - "谷雨/grain&rain" (6th solar term, Apr. 19)
2:23 - "立夏/start of summer" (7th solar term, May 5)
4:03 - "小暑/slight heat" (11th solar term, July 6)
4:51 - Ziqi "Grandma come quick, look at this" (followed by a sentence I couldn't comprehend) "Is it tasty?" 
         - Grandma "It is! "
6:59 - "大暑/great heat" (12th solar term, July 20)
7:28 - After “处暑/the limit of heat" (14th solar term, August 22)
the music from 8:00 is a bit loud and I counldn't hear clearly (Fact is as a manderin speaker I can't quite understand Sichuan dialect lol)
8:48 - (The interface of chat app Wechat)
           the other sent the link of an article about "the life of rice" to Ziqi followed by "Add oil"(it means cheer up)
           Ziqi replied "Thank you sis, I just received your raisins. And I mailed some wine to you, remember to pick it up"
9:10 - Ziqi asked the girl to add wood to the stove after it's burnt out.
9:18 - Grandma told the girl "Oh don't eat that much."
9:40 - Put to dry
10:06 - Pickle and make water come out
13:55 - Use icy water to congeal it
13:59 - Ziqi "Meal time, come! Don't scramble haha"
14:32 - Watermelon peel pickles
17:05 - Fried dumplings with jade
17:31 - Ziqi (calls the other girl's name) "Help me clear out the table, we will eat outside the house today."
             (And on the screen) Watermelon peel with pig's feet meat jelly (pork jelly is very famous in China and I strongly recommend it)
17:39 - Freshly marinated peanuts
17:57 - A pot of casually marinated ingredients (failed to interpret poetry in Ziqi's name for it)
18:01 - Ziqi "Have you cleared the table yet? I'm carring the dishes out."
18:03 - Ziqi "Grandma, it's dinner time!"
18:09 - Ziqi "I'll go get some wine."
18:34 - Ziqi "1 2 3 4, the cups are enough"
             (On the screen) Raisin bread
18:40 - Ziqi "Grandma here is the water for you. Drink slowly it's hot."
18:46 - Ziqi "Let's have wine!"
19:00 - "Cheers and happy every day!"
19:25 - Girl "Grandma look, the moon is really round today."
             Grandma "The moon often comes roundest on 16th day rather than 15th day of a month" (Old saying in Chinese as the lunar calendar was created with some inaccuracy)
19:56 - Ziqi "There is a faint scent in it." (searched for corresponding word for "清香" and not sure if it makes sense.)
20:24 - Again "Happy every day!"
(End)
I may have missed some words like "yes" "come" "Yummy" or some dialogues where Ziqi and her family spoke either too fast in dialect or in a relatively low voice, which I don't think were actually lines for the audience to follow. So I wish everyone feel as relaxed and pleased watching this as I did. And jut let me know if you have any doubts or I made mistakes, thank you!
This girl is simply unbelievable. Her skills are insane!  cooking, building, cutting, brewing, sewing, making furniture, sowing, baking, she could build her own town if she wanted to. she is a savant.
Gracias por manifestar un paraíso permanentemente, a cada uno de tus pasos, Liziqi. Rescate del ser humano verdadero. Honestidad, humildad y simpleza, sapiencia, respeto, alegría, equilibrio, templanza, comprensión, sinceridad, prudencia y cortesía

Can we appreciate how she writes her title, name, and description in english and how she put english captions. She didn't need to do so but she went above and beyond. 
Edit: Thanks for all of the likes!!
The background music is just sooooooooo soothing and relaxing 😍😍😍😍 ....the scenarios, the details, is just so  aesthetic and she herself is just  more than everything how can someone be so hardworking and be humble at the same time now i doubt whether she is even a human being coz she feels more like an angel in  disguise . This is the actual coolness guys .
I love the way she doesn’t waste a thing. I never knew you can eat watermelon skin. 👍🏻
Какая красотаС этим видео отдыхаешь и расслабляешься. Очень красиво😍
Her cameraman shoot everything cenimatically... She does everything effortlessly and smoothly... Satisfying to watch
I want to have such type of garden at my home🤩
Quando é que essa preciosidade volta pro YOUTUBE? Esses vídeos são de uma delicadeza e perfeição ímpar. 😍🥰
A place that is like a paradise. 
This is really satisfying video. I really want to have a life like her❤️
Liz, you're an amazing woman. You've inspired me to garden more and cook different types of food. Keep doing what you're doing! 

For those of you who don't know, btw.  Liz is wearing gloves while handling the walnuts so she doesn't stain her skin. Also, the hull and shell of walnuts can be toxic to surrounding plants and animals so do not ever put anything around these trees and definitely don't compost any nuts, shells, or hulls.
I love watching all of your videos, you are amazing woman.
I tried to make video like you event not as good as you, but I am really Inspired to explore my life in small village..

Big Love from Indonesia...
Böylesi güzel bir kanalı keşffetigim için kendimi cok şanslı hissediyorum bayılıyorum her saniyesini büyük bir begeniyle izliyorum emegine saglık

This woman is amazing, she should have her own TV show, she is so talented, in everything she does.
n sei de onde vc tirou essas paradas, mas parece mt bom, n tenho ideia do q é, mas me aparenta ser suculento
Finally, i started gardening in a little field near my house. I planted some kinds of vegetables like cabbage, bean, corn etc..
I harvested some vegies last week. I was so happy^^
I am really influenced by her. It's a wonderful experience in my life.
Thanks Liziqi~
Please post more videos! I've been patiently waiting for you 💙
Every day waiting for Li Ziqi's return, although you have encountered difficulties temporarily, everything will get better
I remember being a kid and watching a show about Beatrix Potter and her stories, and how the opening was her painting in the woods and then it began to rain, and it was somehow so soft spoken and serene and peaceful, and she runs home to her cozy cottage and makes a cup of tea…these videos remind me of that scene and I absolutely love them!
Watching your videos makes me feel very positive. ❤️
Me encantan sus videos, la chica es bellísima, cocina delicious
I love when she ran through the grapevine trellis she made! Such a cute moment 🥰🥰
Ive been watching your videos and im very impressed how you work and how you find the time to do such amazing things 👏. But my question is:What do you want to achieve in life?does work makes you happy?😁😁i wanna know but till then i just wanna say.You're very talented.👏👏👏
Also we have to give a credit to the awesome cameraman. The way he placed the cameras, the camera movement, the lens focus, his patients working for months.
He is doing incredible job 👍🏻

I think this is the first video I have seen of her's with English subtitles. It makes ever soo much more.
I agree with you. She has charisma, she is incredibly skilled and she knows a lot. Unbelievable admiration and the world has something to learn. Thanks for the comment. I greet you.
Sister, everything you do is so poetic and tasty. God Bless you, grandma and all the cute puppies!
🤗😀😁💖🙏
mt bom, topíssimo
To the cameraman capturing this, you've done an excellent job, the video is so beautiful.
I just love watching her videos, puts me at ease.
She’s living my dream life👍🏻👍🏻 God bless her and her grandmother👍🏻👍🏻
Perempuan yg trampil rajin bekerja, rajin berkebun. Dan pintar memasak serta pandai dan cerdas di dalam merawat kebun buah dan bunga sungguh perempuan ini.. adalah perempuan yg luar biasa tentang bakat Alaminya.
Great video, keep it coming!☺️
I so enjoy her channel, each video is so relaxing and enjoyable to watch!  I find it hard to wait for the newest one!!  :p
I want to live this peaceful life, too. Thank you, sister for sharing your simple and beautiful life💓
The cameraman and her assistant also got to share the food and wine.   ☺️
Before May 2017, she filmed everything herself on a phone.    It was hard.   And it took her two years or so to get things right.   After she became popular, she was able to afford better equipment, and hired one cameraman and an assistant.  They helped the quality and speed of production.
I just came across this channel...oh man! It blows my mind! You are living the life that many people wish to live. Big respect! you deserve every subscriber...and I subscribed as well!
I loved the variety of fruit and nut trees she has in her area. Plus the berries and mushrooms. I wish I had the ability to identify the edible stuff in the woods around my place.
Saya suka banget sama video kakak Liziqi, suasana yg segar dan pemandangan yg indah 🥰
Saya merasa santai, merasa adem banget. Hy I'm from 🇮🇩
Wow… I would try all of the dishes she cooked 🥰

I have spent so many hours watching these videos. They’re so peaceful, it’s like she’s living in a different time but she’s not ☺️😌
You are so skillful  , so creative ,  so thoughtful , so energetic and  you've  a simple beauty too .
I adore her, I adore her home and her gardens, her lovely grandmother and her creative genius.  I am chronically ill and have been for a very long time. I live in the country with many animals and gardens. When I watch her I wish I could do as much as she does but watching her helps me keep working towards wellness so that I can do more things that I love.
Es muy trabajadora mi mas grande admiración
Such clean and pollution free environment woww
Would love to stay here.

Dzień dobry 🙋
Jesteś bardzo pracowitą i gospodarką kobietą. 
Uwielbiam patrzeć na twoją ziemię
I absolutely love how nothing is wasted. We, as a world, waste so much now. Beautiful video as always. ❤
She can multitask and now I know watermelon skins can be cooked and use for just about anything. Amazing!
Да! Суперски все снято! Для меня это релакс! Смотрю каждую серию и  мне это очень нравится! Сама девушка, бабуля, собачки, кошатики, овечки! Так классно! Понятно, что никогда не сделаю этого, просто даже не знаю что используется в приготовлении, но мне так нравится смотреть и музыка успокаивает! Процветания вашему каналу! Спасибо!
She's wonderful and amazing I miss her videos i hope she and her grandmother are well may God 🙏🙏❤️ them
Am really wonder to join with you guys. You're doing such a great job 😍😍😀
Красота ,вкуснота  ,мир и покой  душевный .....!!!
Why am I always so sad when the video ends?
It is such a delight to watch her videos, I don't want it to stop! 
She's full of talents!
Lots of love from my home to yours ❤
Utmost respect to the multi talented Ziqi. Just a shallow question from me, how Miss Ziqi managed to look so beautiful and mesmerizing while doing all this hard labour. She makes it seem so effortless and enjoyable. Lots to learn from.
Liziki, parabéns pelo lindo trabalho. Amo assistir os seus vídeos. Bjs do 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷

Maravilhoso!
This is beautiful!! Its so simple and the mud balls are so cute!!!!!!
So happy to see the camera man eating and enjoying with everyone also. Such a wonderful video!  :-)
Mujer admirable...Me encantan tus videos y tu fortaleza...
5 years with her videos. So sad that she don’t post anymore bc of the rights issues. But I will stay and hope for new stuff some day. ♥️
A life where there are no working hours, no permission is required to take a break, no one judges you....just simple, pure, hardworking is only yours.  Wish everyone can lead that life
О Бог мой,когда я вырасту и стану келинкой,дай мне тогда сил как у неё🙏🏼♥️
How a beautiful woman can manage so gently her relationship with Nature: enchanting!!
This is actually a new year celebration dinner, focusing on the use of grapes & watermelons for a feast like no others. I like Liziqi's celebratory calendar, which is basically year round. We should all honor nature's bounty, respect and protect her life-giving generosity.
Hermoso liziqi como cada cosa que muestras 
Un abrazo desde chile 🇨🇱
this is what life is all about I love it keep it up young lady keep looking after Grandma  I had to subscribed
Que lindo❤❤
You’re so amazing. I’ve never seen someone so hardworking and dedicated. God bless you ❤️

Liziqi is a mirror. She just shows us. Without saying anything she shows what life would be like if we took on the roll of caretaker again, and leave behind the life of consuming. The wonderful thing about nature is that when we take care of her, she takes care of us. 

I remember my grandmother having a big garden where she grew her own crops. As children we would get lost in the garden. It was wonderful, everything was edible. Being a survivor from the second world war, my grandmother's biggest fear was shortage. That's why she became completely self sufficient. She had a garden and knew the names of all the plants, birds and insects therein. She also made her own clothes, and she cooked the most delicious food and she wasn't rich or anything, far from it. My grandparents couldn't afford much. But my grandmother never had to pay for food from the supermarket, she harvested way more than she could eat on her own and she gave the rest of the produce to her family members and friends. When she became too old, she always regretted not being able to work in the garden anymore. My biggest regret is not learning more from her. So much knowledge died with her. Now I am learning it all on my own, with snippets of knowledge left behind by her. It's magical.

Taking care of nature is our best shot at becoming happy. We have been made, designed if you will, to change our surroundings; that is inherently what humans do, we're like ants. But we have the choice to consume our surroundings and see it wither away, or to take care of it and make it flourish. It starts with making a garden, however small it may be, and making it grow.
I want nothing more than to live a life like this
One of the best things about her is that she doesn't waste anything, everything gets reused in some way or another
No mobile phone,  no internet,
She is enjoying her beautiful life with beautiful nature❤️❤️❤️
She is a very accomplished cook, and I am impressed with the heavy lattice she built. She is also very pretty.
You are a all rounder you do everything and anything. I wish you well. Good luck for more and more future success. Superb video. I love watching them 👌🏼🌟🌟🌟
Long live 
Your videos are so peaceful 
Your hard work is so rewarding.

I will like to see the life of gourds how you eat them when they are young and some crafts too! a lot of appreciation for al what you do, you are amazing, grandma is so lucky, i wish her a lot of health and years.
الفيديو عبارة عن راحة نفسية 💜💜💜
Her excitement near the middle when she finished building the structure and was calling to her grandmother made me smile
I would travel around the world to find something amazing as her .
Dear Liziqi, from New Zealand I say thankyou ... for perseverance in what you love doing, thankyou for sharing parts of your life and skills to encourage us. Thankyou for showing us your Chinese life. In NZ your Chinese people have been wonderful market gardeners and orchard growers, feeding New Zealand with nature’s food for many many decades. I hope you can continue your work and I pray you will receive great reward in your heart for being brave. Love from NZ.
第一次看到妳的頻道。。。很嚮往你們大自然的生活! 可看到植物慢慢地生長，狗狗休閒地陪著你 ， 更可享受耕種的成果 !也欣賞你的廚藝, 令我垂涎三尺!😋😋😋🤤🤤🤤
Your skills, elegance and beauty would suit you well all over the world. You can without question inspire women from all walks of life to have confidence in themselves.

Hopefully you'll make it world wide. I don't care for television, but your production of essential life skills has given me more than a few hours of enjoyment, and when possible, I tell others about you here in the United States.

Tell grandma and grandpa hi for me!

Good luck Liz

Love your videos💫💖💫
Where can I get those wine fermentation canisters?
İzlemek zihnimi temizliyor ruhumu aydınlatıyor resmen yanına gelip yardım etmek istiyorum kolay gelsin
Dumplings look amazing! And to think, Americans are told the rine will give you a stomach ache. I'll be trying it.  Ty for sharing. God bless you and your beautiful family.
Xem video thấy khung cảnh làng quê đẹp, yên tĩnh như này sướng thật.
Mình thì làm việc tại thành phố, sống nhanh, ăn nhanh, bận rộn công việc, thời gian yên tĩnh không nhiều, đôi khi muốn bỏ cuộc sống thành thị về với thôn quê của mình.
I first watched her videos when i was laying in bed and barely move cause i had severe slip disc..this inspired me to wake up and be active during my younger age ..now i am healthy and as active as i can be..blessed her for making this vids💜
Organic, beautiful, hardworking ❤
She literally uses everything she has to her reach, she doesn’t even waste food. Like omg I wish I could be like her🥺
Really happy got this recommendation from youtube ❤️ reminds me of home, so satisfying, beautiful lady ❤️❤️
Such a peaceful and beautiful life 😘🌸🌸
I love the way you live your life wow you are extraordinary woman with out wasting every single second. God bless you 😇
Love ur videos so beautiful and calming thank u for posting 💕💕🦋🦋
Liziqi is the best cooking show ever, the freshness of the ingredients and beautiful countryside home is totally a heaven. Just looking at it make me fresh. Liziqi anyday anytime.
The fact that even Lizqi can’t cut the watermelon in half perfectly helps me feel like I’m not a total failure 😂
Эстетическое удовольствие 🙌
Wow lovely recipe, it looks very nice and mouth watering
I love your videos ❤️
Damn this woman is so strong she is so pretty too and she has one of the most fruitful gardens that I've seen. Her content is so beautiful too and calming.
She is the strongest woman that i have ever seen with multi skills from the engineer, landscaper and chef. BIG love from me.
Now, it seems Ziqi has started to pamper her die-hard fans by increasing her videos duration! Bravo Ziqi! We all here love you.     ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Great editing great skills excellent cooking method all in all very good ♥️
These videos are so comforting 😉
I wonder how much time she took to make this one video??? Your patients level is really incredible👍
Переезжаю жить к Liziqi😄💟 все очень красиво 😍
Has anyone noticed that theres no plastic anywhere. Imagine the rest of our planet like this, clean, natural and beautiful 
Love your videos Liziqi all the best frm England
I already watched all your videos! Still waiting for your new uploads. ❤️ From PH
Оператору, режиссеру и главной героине моё почтение!

I would love to build cooking site like hers.
Totally thought she was going to make plates out of those watermelon shells 🤣
i just love how so gets everything from around her, and creates her own magical garden of beauty in the process, So much better than just planting a seed, she creates a work of art in her space.
Simple and beautiful life of her she is so perfect what's she does love ❤from India🇮🇳.
I want Gordon Ramsay to come here and try her food because I bet he will want her recipes. Her food always looks so good and fresh!
She is the best and amazing talented you tuber. Love to watch her video .so natural.🤩👍👍👍👍💝👍
This family is blessed by God!!!what a peaceful lifestyle!!
One day I'd learn even just one of the things she did in this video.  
GOAL: Learn to make the Spiced Peanuts.
I genuinely think there should be a movie made about her...  So inspiring
Indah banget pemandangan alamnya..
I feel like even her grandma is amazed by her granddaughter's many talents
Wow..the kids nowadays have to watch ur videos..such a nice lifestyle ..looks like u r creating the world
This is the kind of lifestyle that I always dream. Away from the city and just create a beautiful fruit and vegetable garden and raise pigs, chickens and cattle. I will exchange it to nothing from the city.
I just realised most ppl don't know why you peel off the skin from the walnut :x if it's so young and fresh, it tastes very bitter. Old ones, dried are not (plus there is no way to peel of the skin anymore)- that is the kind you buy at a store
I miss you ziqi, stay healthy, love 😘❤️
Maravilhosa
This is what humans are longing for: being close to earth, working hard and enjoying the fruits of one's work.
Semoga sehat selalu mbak Liziqi amin👍😊
I've read too many Chinese novels and i can't help but think that you're like the female protagonist of one of those stories 😂😂
Yêu cô gái và những món cô ấy nấu quá
I am passionate about watching your videos,Liziqi 😍
That was paradise place omg, and the foods are really looking the best. Shes really great woman with high ability on kitchen, and many skills. That beats men.
The fact that some ppl still think perfection isn't real when a whole Li Ziqi exsists
Oh Ziqi, how I have missed you.  I hope the difficulties with your "partners" gets resolved soon.  Much <3
Great women and she is doing hard work beautiful life and healthy food🍲👍
Chị giỏi lắm ạ ngoại em mê chị lắm mong chị ra nhiều Video mới nữa ạ em yêu chị
Her garden is so bountiful.👍👍👍
Coi video của chị em cảm thấy sự bình yên thoải mái
Li is a curious person and she looks things up to discover techniques for doing things. She can also ask local villagers about traditional processes. And she can use her imagination as well - to create new savory dishes and projects. Everything you see her do, you can learn to do also, (if you have the resources) if your body works. You can plant seeds, harvest crops, chop,  cut, fry and  season. You don't have to memorize everything all at once and Li didn't learn all of these things overnight. Some are regional, therefore part of her heritage. No one knows how to "do" everything, but she's wiling to try new things. It's called human agency. Accept for the aesthetic appeal seen on this channel, human beings have been doing everything you see from hundreds to thousands of years - for survival. So, she has simply added pretty bows to the whole thing, which we should have been doing from the start.
Liziki ur every video is something different delicious. Plz give some more details of recipe. Much love from India!
i really appreciate when little parts of more "modern life" (can't think of a better term) is included in these videos, i think people have a tendency to think of how you live as some kind of fairytale when really it's just a real way people live!
Beautiful video, really love to watch🌻🌺🍀
A woman full of rich life and of plenty to share with all... simple and beautiful video during the beginning, a heart full of caring... transformation of growth gives a bounty to enjoy drink with others. Thus, showing the countryside of China true of lifestyle!
疫情中更夢想的生活、而且更活化開心的細胞、子柒真棒、👍👍👍🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀🍀💃💃
That guy at the end is a cameraman, I swear. Every single detail was well captured.
今天是2022年的第一天，重新看李子柒的这段视频，充满了新鲜感。我要做西瓜🍉皮的凉菜。澳洲正当炎夏😊
We can see that there is something wrong in this world when we see people who click on ''dislike'' on such a pure and amazing video
My goodness 😲 she's so strong that she crushed all the walnut by herself
Pertama kali menonton aku langsung jatuh cinta dengan konten anda.. ❤❤❤🇮🇩
I miss your videos. You are the best content creator on YouTube. Period.
Its relaxing to watch for those with anxiety
amo muito
she's truly inspiring, she's a machine, she took my hat off, she's wonderful, she doesn't need a man, a man needs her.
Your food looks unbelievable! Wow! 👋👋👋👋👋👋👋❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
She has a smartphone! And that vehicle (whatever that's called)! This is the most amount of technology I've seen in a Li Ziqi video 💖🤗💖🤗🌟🌟
Por ella.  Le doy el gusto al campo y me gustaría tener uno  y ser y Ser como ella amo todo lo natural
Wow, the best video I’ve seen on YouTube. You are one of a kind liziqi 🤍
muy bonito todo buen trabajo en todo
I just want to experience living there and learning a lot from her. She's so cool! 💖
Wonderful video thank you ❤
For the last 50 years of my life, I didn't even know we can eat the watermelon peels! I'm so amazed by this young lady. Salute.
Multi tasking lady .. bravo, I love your cooking... Thanks 👍
Какая красивая, трудолюбивая  девушка!
Miss you Liziqi
Saya harap anda bisa cepat kembali buat video
Salam dari Bali  <3
Does she own the whole forest? Looks like she has everything she needs. It is easily accessible to her.
I want to live there 💕
She does everything, wastes nothing and is always beautiful. A real fairy.
She is a masterpiece lots of love from India
Great efforts 🤩💥
好羨慕這種生活
Omg has anyone started an official Liziqi fan club yet ?! This young lady could sell cookbooks, clothing, gardening books, home decor and accessories. And her name Liziqi is perfect for a brand name.

What a good life she is living
الطبيعة جميلة جدا كالجنة، إنها تشعرني بالراحة النفسية
Ia tampak hidup bersama neneknya. Dan ia banyak kebun tumbuhan yang ia punyai di bumi. sepertinya ribuan hektar tanah yg ia miliki tak sia sia ia manfaatkan di planet kebun. Seperti serasa Surga yg ia ciptakan di planet bumi perempuan cantik pintar memasak ini sangatlah berbakat . Inilah bakat Alami dari Nenek moyang nya. Perempuan Secantik ini.
Esa mujer vale oro puro
Don't understand how people can dislike this video. I like to watch it relaxing in my bed. It's totally amazing 😍😊😍. Greetings from beautiful Scotland. Lots of love. Who likes Liziqi videos? Me 😊
How blessed are you ❤️
我真的很喜欢你的视频，你所做的一切都是一门艺术 我学到了很多关于中国文化的知识，感谢大佛的启迪和来自墨西哥的问候
Liziqi....I love the Way you treat you re grand mother...hope  bathin of you and all teams always stay healty and safe
It's so beautiful it makes you wanna cry.
Hard work and dedication have the meaning only if surrounding environment supports
Ummm, I just joined this channel and to me she is the definition of the perfect relationship between humans and mother earth and how we all should live.  I'm in love with her! Not creepy just watching her is so relaxing and wonderful and I love how she treats her Granny!  She is my new obsession.

She is so cute. The big love form her dish. Thank you!
I love to watch your Videos. You are awaresome. Thank you❤
Te ves tan linda tan hermosa sabes eres muy especial nadie como tú cómo una princesa de tiempos antiguos
Девочка моя виноград мыть нельзя когда делаеш вино.Здоровье вашей бабушке🥰🥰👍👍👍
I've seen comments say "she is rich" and "she could afford everything", so what if she's rich? Is she sitting around having maids, cooks, drivers and other helpers just like actual rich people that live in mansions do? NO! She's a hard-working gal and she deserves every single bit of everything she has and even more, and whoever disagrees with that can go and hate on where actual rich people with all the luxuries are just sitting on their asses the whole day doing nothing. 
That's all i have to say. Good day!
Nature Maravilha Perfect😻 🌹🌻🌼😚
You should become woman of the year
You are a great inspiration for others
I never saw a Youtuber with so many skills, so hard working, so creative and looking like a Disney princes

This is a super angel! I don’t know what else she cannot do? Every time I watch her film I feel as if I was living in another world. I love the water melon drinks she made, It looks so natural and healthy. Love to watch she clipped the food that she made for her grandma. How sweet and warm. And that crickets sound! Omg, I wanna be there too!

The cameraman is so funny! 😂💞
Такая молодец 👍
PORQUE  NO DAS LOS INGREDIENTES DE LAS RECETAS QUE   HACES?
I thought it was so cute how, after she put up the arches, she started running under them and laughing. Good job sis!
She seems like a fantasy figure from another time, another world even, like a beautiful mythical figure.
怎麼會有這麼完美的女人😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
очень хорошо такие прекрасное жизнь
A beautiful thing you do is work belonging to nature
どこに何があるのか把握してるの凄すぎる。
I love the moments where she feeds her crew at the table too xD
She is the best. I want a life like this
All the 'village food' vloggers were simply copying Liziqi. Her presentation,  music.. even from the flower arrangement to  natural water flow. 
Now she has taken her presentation to another level,  which is very hard to copy. You make wine from store bought grapes,  I'll start with growing grapevines.
历害！還會用西瓜皮去掉烹調中加入那麼多的辛香料產生的燥熱，起一個食材寒熱的平衡作用！新鮮核桃去掉那層棕色的內皮是如此的快，真是仙女！
Mi admiración para ti , eres increíble haciendo tanta belleza junta...entre arar la tierra, cosechar los frutos, cocinar manjares con pura naturaleza y confeccionar prendas....algo de ti tengo, me encanta la naturaleza ese espíritu natural para trabajar.....Un abrazo inmenso y fraterno desde Lima - PERU.
6:04 so heart-warming
La admiro? A esta mujer eres grande? Te mando muchos besos ..desde Perú
Чудноо...а холодец это по нашему))!!
It is always a pleasure to see this channel grow. We all are here because this makes us feel good. This channel always reminds me that nothing can heal us better than nature. We cannot run away from the fact that we belong to the nature. We were, are and will always belong to her.
Вау,я влюблен!Успехов тебе,крошка!
Ik wacht nog steeds op jou nieuw video ❤️❤️❤️
You are a strong woman. I wish you have a happy life 👌👌👌
Always with a smile, dynamic, gentle, good tempered, and radiant with beauty. How does she manage it all. I dream she would make a video to explain that to me!
Hi 
I m indian I m Big fan of Liziqi 💕💕💕
She is multi talented 😍😍
The way she ran happily like a child and when she called out for grandma....I’m sobbing
cả nhà ngồi ăn những món ăn ngon trong không khí đầm ấm mà mính chảy cả nước miếng. chúc cả nhà hạnh phúc
一人で生き残るあの兄を誇りに思う 👏
So beautiful good job my friends you are the inspiration of all ladies like you...
She seems completely unaware of the camera's presence. This is beautiful in so many ways.
Muy rico Todo!!! Desde Spain
I can never get tired of lizqi. 
I like how they included the camera man at the end.
j'ai jamais vu ...j'ai vu la vidéo une nième fois...c'est de l'art ...j'ai beau attendu une nouvelle vidéo
She prepared dishes suitable for her grandma, soft, stronger flavours and chewable.
thanks for sharing a beautiful part of your life
where can we get those fermenting containers and dehydrating trays from???
0:15 its look like hydrophonic rockwall techniques of seedling
她己經很久沒有出 新視頻了，又希望她快點出 新視頻，又體諒她的困難，最好的支持她的辦法，
就是繼續觀看她己有的視頻 = 幫她克服困難，以便她早日 出新視頻。
Это очень красиво
The text on the phone says that her friend had sent her some dried grape and was checking if she received it, she thanked her friend and was planning to send her friend some wine.
I guess you guys might be curious about it.
En güzel yaşam🌱🌿☘️
what a beautiful rural life .
I wish I could try all those dishes
Peaceful video   and calm background music 🎶❤️
El lugar y la vida que  sueño
I always forget that it takes you time to upload videos because it's not just a normal random video. The way you show life in nature as plants is so beautiful. I've no words how much I love your videos. Sometimes I think of having a life like yours but I've already made my choice when I had to. Currently I'm studying medicine and I definitely can't have a life like yours but you really do give a peace to my heart. May God always bless you.
Wow... Soooo wonderful and enjoyable. 👍👍👍
A good woman is hard to find,
    and worth far more than diamonds.
Her husband trusts her without reserve,
    and never has reason to regret it.
Never spiteful, she treats him generously
    all her life long.
She shops around for the best yarns and cottons,
    and enjoys knitting and sewing.
She’s like a trading ship that sails to faraway places
    and brings back exotic surprises.
She’s up before dawn, preparing breakfast
    for her family and organizing her day.
She looks over a field and buys it,
    then, with money she’s put aside, plants a garden.
First thing in the morning, she dresses for work,
    rolls up her sleeves, eager to get started.
She senses the worth of her work,
    is in no hurry to call it quits for the day.
She’s skilled in the crafts of home and hearth,
    diligent in homemaking.
She’s quick to assist anyone in need,
    reaches out to help the poor.
She doesn’t worry about her family when it snows;
    their winter clothes are all mended and ready to wear.
She makes her own clothing,
    and dresses in colorful linens and silks.
Her husband is greatly respected
    when he deliberates with the city fathers.
She designs gowns and sells them,
    brings the sweaters she knits to the dress shops.
Her clothes are well-made and elegant,
    and she always faces tomorrow with a smile.
When she speaks she has something worthwhile to say,
    and she always says it kindly.
She keeps an eye on everyone in her household,
    and keeps them all busy and productive.
Her children respect and bless her;
    her husband joins in with words of praise:
“Many women have done wonderful things,
    but you’ve outclassed them all!”
Charm can mislead and beauty soon fades.
    The woman to be admired and praised
    is the woman who lives in the Fear-of-God.
Give her everything she deserves!
    Adorn her life with praises!
I like the content of your channel.two thumbs up.👍👍
Whaooo que hermoso lugar parece una película
Чудесная девушка🌹
I feel so intimidated because I can't do any of that 😂 especially how can you be good at so many things at once? She is just amazing
Looks how happiest her when she's finished that🥺
Every single leftovers not wasted, the world can be better if everyone keeps practice it. While some corner of the world,  people are still in hungry Liziqi keep find the solution for food. The good food.
this girl seems to own a massive plot of lands
Хоть под конец жизни увидела  сказочную жизнь. Люди трудятся от всей души и живут всей душой.
Доброго времени суток! Спасибо за видео.

Alguien más siente que estos videos son adictivos? eso es por que nuestros receptores de nuestro cuerpo humano están alineados y diseñados para esto. Lástima que los medios de comunicación por todos lados nos metieron en la cabeza la comida industrializada. Pero tomemos conciencia de ello, tratemos de volver en lo que se pueda a nuestro origen, " La naturaleza"
No entendí nada pero lo disfruté...🤩
She is all the man, all the woman, all the chef, all the waitress, all the brains anyone will ever need. Phenomenal woman she is.
Enak sekali ,nyaman tenang hidup di sana, semua berasal dari alam ❤️
Добрый день! Подскажите в каком районе Китая она живет?
Очень интересно изучить климат этой территории.
W H A T how did she know those trees were USEFUL they look DEAD to me WHAT. HER WISDOM AND KNOWLEDGE. I WANT IT
this is how people in a perfect world live life like.
I want to eat watermelon right now so badly 😿
Доброй ночи ! Наконец-то увидела вас ! Я рада, что вы появились ! Какая красивая природа, музыка, пение птиц, я испытываю восторг. Я восхищаюсь вами, вы молодец. Всем вам здоровья, удачи, всех благ..👍👏👏👏🌹🌹🌹❤
Nice to see grandma getting faded on the homemade wine
Amazing🍃💚
Amazing video☀️🇨🇳, I love This☀️🍇🍉, congratulations from krangi Singapore☀️🇸🇬, I am Peruvian country of INKA empire☀️🇵🇪🦁.
Es una belleza todo
She is like a character from a studio Ghibli movie 😍😍
Just imagine that she's now a multimillionaire. She doesn't have to do anything and can have helpers left and right attending the garden and cook all the food that she likes. And yet she's still going at it. It shows that she's living the life that she loves!
此視頻 ： “瓜間一壼酒，⋯”  與  “黃瓜的一生” 、 “⋯秋葵，和竹筒路的一生⋯”  ⋯ 可稱得上是“姐妹作”，共同之處 ：大工程、
多收穫 ⋯的視頻。
It's so weird seeing her use a phone and get things ordered to her. I'm just used to her working around the farm, making food and building things like bamboo furniture. Sometimes I forget that she lives in our time too. XP
finally an interaction with the camera man - I loved to see that

thanks camera man for all your hard work
Loooooove this show it’s the best
God bless you 🙂 you are the best
You are so hardworking love from india
Wow 😍, love from india ❤️
Is there anything that this woman cannot do? The videos are so peaceful and calm.
Amazing actually
这个农活、朴实肯干、知识丰富👍各种设计、施工、建造、一手拿、厉害👍

Hi what did you put in the wine fermentation and how long did you ferment it?
唯一华人频道拥有最多外国人粉丝
没有之一 💪🏆
Wow! Such an amazing woman.
Can someone please identify the 6 items in the tray at 17:55?  Also, what is that small clump of dark berry-looking item at 12:33?  Thank you.
I have just come across to her channel via a local newspaper article and I just started from beginning and watched few videos. I am incredibly impressed by her as like million others. 

Her life, work, skills, content should be taught as a study material in Colleges for art & culture, entrepreneurship, creativity, hard work independence, and happiness. ❤️

Her videos are a learning experience for future generations.
Красиво, прям как на Руси.
Es un belleza todo
Delicia comen provecho 😋
For me, you are an angel on the earth. 🙏🏼
I like it... Natural life 👍👍
Is there anything that she can't do? This is woman empowerment in true sense. She is just unstoppable 💪🏻👌🏻❤️
🌹🥰🇧🇷🇧🇷
She's literally living a life in diff world...
And of course a girl at heart
She is so amazing.🤩🙏👍👍👍👍👍

<3 very nice video so peaceful<3
This is some culinary genius here
അടിപൊളി ❤️
欣赏这样的田园生活方式，非常享受慢生活的感觉。来自纽约的问候。
Bella vida!!!!
The thing that warms my heart the most is watching this industrious lady feed her grandmother. My grandmother is past and was one of the best cooks. I wish she would have lived long enough and well enough to sit at my table. What a blessing.
Such a wonderful video
Good luck Liziqi
Иногда мне представляется, что мы просто впроголодь живём по сравнению с ними. 😂
你真有才。這樣好。注意安全，順心愉快。
I think her grandma is behind in all her success.😊
I really want drink that homemade wine.
3:34 I obviously do not know this person but she seems so genuine, caring and sweet. These videos are inspiring. She’s such a hard worker. These videos make me believe that she could do anything.

The landscape is beautiful and the way the video is shot with the music matches perfectly. 

I wish her the best.
堅果P烤的有模有樣，葡萄酒發酵的好，釀酒器做的很漂亮很科學，還會放進小型漂亮的橡木桶中⋯，洋為中用！再點贊！

Best liziqi in the world ❤️❤️❤️
When i watch her doing these things i start to imagine that people did these things like her many centuries ago, maybe they did not have internet access or ready meals to it, but they lived happily  in a healthy life
我是你的最大粉絲，媽媽..自2019年以來❤️我愛你❤️📍
自分は4歳頃に親が離婚して父親がいなくて母親いるけどだらしなくて掃除できない人で祖母に教えてもらって何でも１人で小さい頃からやってきてリーズチーさんが自分にそっくりだなと思って視聴してます。境遇が本当にそっくりでびっくりしています。自分も頑張っていきたいと思いました。
This woman is every man's dream. In every sense
Extra tallented and agile for everything, I am also learning from you..
Why you can do  everything? So good👏👏👏👏👏
Oh I love how she shares food with cameraman..and all enjoying together

Повезет вашему мужу, вот таких надо брать в жены надо
So you're telling me that she took dead dried up grape branches from the side of the road, regrow them and make wine out of them? Amazing.
you are amazing multi talented
한국산 포도도 맛있어 보이고, 한국요리를 중국인이 맛있게 잘 만드네요.
Rindu video baru liziqi😔😊
She is so amazing
Amazing video 👌🙏
Finally, at the end of the video...
Ziqi, Grandma, Minguo (her cute assistant), and Xiaogang (the cameraman) gathering together. They've enjoyed their garden party.
wowww....love from srilanka... Keep it up...!!!
Nothing is too difficult- hard work and determination
There's haters but none of them want to mess with her😂
So lovely😍
lovely video! I am an organic farmer from Argentina. Where can I write to you in private?
Hi Li Ziqi 👋 Hello from our land in Australia, near Melbourne. I’ve been catching up on many of your videos and love to watch snippets of your life and the amazing work that you do. I love to see you with your granny and how many laughs you have together. I think your pots and cooking styles are so interesting and beautiful... I also too love to cook over wood fire but it’s amazing to see it all happen traditional Chinese style! I wish I could try all your delicious food and am excited to get back to China Town in Melbourne and all the amazing food they have available there when Covid goes away here xx Rebekah
its unique😌💪❤️
Who else note that,she is expert in optimum utilisation of all the resources. Even she doesn't waste the skin of fruits too.. really admire it.
So lovely😍
Круто👍👏👏👏👏👏
Very interesting and nice view
Мне срочно надо такую жену))
I want this kind of life simple but happy
"Grandma I finished it!! Ha ha!!" That was so charming, and innocent and even the way she spun and skipped around too ❤
Наверное, все таки придется сделать эксперимент и сварить арахис, так интересно, что за вкус у него получается?
I love your hard work, so gorgeous
素晴らしい！
Tidak tau harus berkata apa lagi, di sekitar rumahnya banyak sekali buah2an.. Sayur sayur2an dan juga bunga bunga." di setiap video anda slalu memberi kejutan apa yang akan anda masak dan anda pergi ke setiap tempat yang berbeda beda semua pemandangan nya indah2."😍🥰🌸🌹🌺🌻🌼🌷🌱🪴🌿🍀🍁🍂
i miss to see a new content from you liziqi....where are you...😭😭
Love how she cares for her camera guy as well
It's beautiful.
I like the way you close the gate😂 anyway i enjoy watching all of your videos👍
マジで美味そうなんだよな...
小鸡在吃葡萄🍇太可爱了😁
7:20 Это же холодец!! ^^
I'm from India.. there is so worst condition between border of China-India. But still I love❤ watching you and I feel love about China because of you 😍
一個讓人看了很舒心的影片
I mean, what is this woman incapable of? She can really do everything. Now, that's one sure type of a strong, independent woman. Always loved your vids, Liziqi. Much love! 🤗♥️
Beautiful ❤️
So natural.so peaceful 🤗aahhh
Bạn giỏi quá 🏆
Seus vídeos são maravilhosos.
Só não entendi o porque da  uva amadurecer primeiro se a melancia foi plantada antes, pelo menos na ordem do vídeo foi.
Boa noite do Brasil.
食べてみたいどんな味するんだろうとても美味しそう
I would never thinking of going anywhere,, this place such a heaven with all fresh food from nature.. love it
อยากใช้ชีวิตแบบนี้จังเลยค่ะ อยู่กับธรรมชาติคงอารมดีน่าดู
I wish that I can be her sister ❤
Come back liziqi..missed ur video. .
I love that she’s a millionaire but still has a cracked phone hahahaha
Chị ơi tại sao lâu rồi chị không ra video nữa vậy ạ??
I like the fact that she's frugal and thrift in every way possible. She's isn't even bothered by the condition of her phone.. Even if it's cracked in some parts it's okay as long as it works. Imagine if everyone was like her.
乡间生活真令人向往
LIZIQI ABSOLUTELY KNOWLEDGEABLY SKILLFUL AND SHE MULTIPLY TALENTED.
LOVE HER CHANNELS.👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🇸🇬
Beautiful lifestyle
Every thing she does is so beautiful and elegant. Moving boulders put me to shame.
The people around her are very lucky
I really like that she always shares with the camera crew.  Filming a feast, and not being allowed to have any would suck.
The best woman you ever wish to live with.
It’s nice to see everyone who helps her make the vids and her grandma!! They must have happy stomaches every day lmao
Какой замечательный климат, где живёт ЛиЗиГи, а у нас зимой - 35С.
Please come back ... My mom is a big fan of yours and she can't stop talking about you everytime we watch YouTube on tv 😭😭😭💕
李子柒幾時才有得再睇妳 拍片好掛住妳哦。
Takjub bgt sama independent women 😭😭😭❣❣❣
ur videos help me calm down and fall asleep
This lady here can end world hunger singlehandedly. Nothing goes to waste, wow!!!
Чудесная,сильная Женщина!

So nice and beautiful good job liziqi
Saya sangat suka dengan pengambilan bingkai videonya, saya banyak belajar di video ini

wonderful family
E ấy rất giỏi tôi rất ngưỡng mộ e ấy .. đã lâu k thấy e ấy lên sóng ...
She is living in heaven & making her life & place like paradise
lucky camera man get to try everything she makes in the vid
i wonder how they manage to capture every plant's details, from seeds to a grown up plant then their blooming and then the growing part of every fruits.After that she make different video with different fruits or plants and put the full life of those plants.Its so satisfying, specially when she picks up those fruits form tree💖.For most  of the video  she has to give so much passion, time and patience at the same time. And that's worth it.
لي اكثر من سنه م شفت مقاطعها 🥺💜💜💜💜
A beautiful hard working woman. Kinda in love.
Hi I am an Indian. I like your garden and I have your that voilet cute flower❤️🌸

When people still argue about is tomato a fruit or vegetable, she added another problem by cooking watermelon

My goal in life is to have a garden with so many fruits and veggies to eat so I can walk outside and pick them right from the trees.
Wish to have a wife like her. She is a dream girl.
Очень красивая девушка

I would give anything to have a dinner you've cooked. Everything looks amazing.
Я всегда просто  с огромным удовольствием и уважением смотрю эти видео. 
Какой тяжёлый труд, девушка  такая хрупкая. Как повезло маме или бабушке, вырастить  такую заботливую и трудолюбивую  дочь или внучку.
Китай будет супердержавой и не на словах, потому, что китайцы трудолюбивы до судорог. А у нас народ не хочет  жить в деревне и садить для себя хоть пару грядок.....да.....
I’ve seen quite a few of your videos; they are fascinating, but this one in particular is so uplifting and such a pleasure to watch.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you!
الطبيعة واو حبيت😍😍😍
i'm late to see this video, yet I'm so happy that I discovered your channel. i was very much stressed and sad but after watching this I feel so relaxed . Thanks to you. May you reach greater heights
Wah keren 🇲🇨
I cannot explain why her videos make me so happy.
Love watching her videos! She inspires me! When I have my own home I'm goin to grow vegetables, fruits etc.

By the way THE CAMERA PERSON NEVER FAILS!!! HE/SHE IS DOING AN AMAZING JOB! VERY PROFESSIONAL!
Liziqi is so enchanting and everything she does. Her videos are so alluring I can watch for hours and not get bored. Congratulations to her and her team for such an amazing youtube channel!
grape wine is traditional Korean culture
Aaaaa seus vídeos me fazem chorar, mas chorar no bom sentindo... E tudo tão lindo❤️❤️😭
看她一個小姑娘，搭一個那麼大的木頭架子，還有那麼多個大木頭架，形成一條“大走廊”，
還不止這樣，在“大走廊”兩旁種很多不同蔬菜，水果，連“大走廊”頂部也是瓜果 ⋯ ⋯
This is my ideal life style, i don't know how she learn all that, really want to learn and have the skills of this lady. I admire you! 🇵🇦
Photographer deserves as much appreciation as that much of liziqi and grandma🙏
- Your video is very well done: Many emotions, idyllic, rustic, natural, ... bearing the beauty of the countryside. 
- The scene is very professional, the director of the scene - the angle is very good, very beautiful. Highlight what you do with landscape, weather, space, time. Make viewers feel beautiful and emotional, more love the homeland. 
- Viewers learn a lot from what you do. 
- Thank you so much, for letting us see so many good videos. I like so much!
Delicious served the food is for quite the soul and save peace.
Aí como queria experimentar essas receitas deliciosas 😋👍👏 hummm 👍 like 💯🔔👏👏👏🌹❤️💞
девушка мечты!согласен был бы на все с такой рядом)!
Me: "throwing watermelon skin away is useless."
Liziqi:"You can make watermelon tea and various side dishes." 
😂😂😂
I love your garden. It has all kinds of vegetables. I wish I had a garden like you. I also like to do it myself. You are wonderful.😊😊
Смотрю её видео ради того, чтобы отдохнуть морально. Она потрясающая девушка.
Me encantan tus vídeos todos los espero con ansiedad muchos besitos,todo lo que haces me encanta saludos desde España,hinojos provincia de Huelva
The most hard working person I've seen. So inspiring
Весь ролик смотрел на девушку ❤️
This is the very informative and interesting video that I every seen , they make video for how many months I think, a lot of effort they give ...😍😍😍
Wow. Wonderful.
this feels like a sanctuary to me. Living in a busy hustle and bustle life where everyone is moving so fast to earn more money. I just wish to live in a slow paced country life where I don't have to worry about money for food and all everyday.
This sister is really smart, I admire her so much, I wish her good health
My grandmother used to make those watermelon skin dishes when I was young. So delicious… miss those times… people who dislike the videos , may you find a a peace in your life. Being a hater is miserable.
I really like your life 😍😍😍
Impressive how hard working she is doing. people should taught their kids like her. 👍
First time subscriber✨✨ nice video....
Her grandma is very lucky. Having the best of her life..
O que mais me impressiona é o cuidado com os animaizinhos, a dedicação a disciplina e a beleza deste lugar que ela deixou como prova de que existe um paraiso na terra. Parabéns mocinha você é simplesmente fantástica.   给我印象最深的是对小动物的关心、对纪律的奉献以及她留下的这个地方的美丽，作为地球上有天堂的证明。 恭喜年轻的女士，你简直太棒了。
我喜欢看这些视频，它让我感觉很好我也想去外婆家🥺想念她，祝她身体健康💜

Есть что-то, чего эта девушка не умеет. Какая красивая и богатая природа у вас.
This makes me wanna be a part of her family now
Покормите апаратора 😂

Woaah saya suka videonya menarik banget
I can not take myself watching, this is a pure wisdomness. At this young age she is equipped and doing whatever it needs to be done on her own.
Amazing! Love this so much!
Умница, все делает с душой.
I'm from India I love your videos
Que maravillosas manos que preparan esas delicias desde el cultivo de la tierra
매우 좋은
I just started watching this. I can't believe her cooking. How many is she feeding? Just her and the older woman? A lot of work. Looks delicious!
Красивое ты человек,очень уважаю,и труда любови,и удача!!!
She's one of a kind. Been following all her videos and it amazed me each and every one of them. I salute her for being natural and real. She's absolutely adobrable and rare. Supporting her all the way from Philippines 🇵🇭

Who else is from Philippines?
LiZiQi is a great worker she cook's she plants she harvest she cans she stock up for the winter what a wonderful worker she is.I would want to learn all that she has learned in her life.
最可爱的女孩、看完了我感觉好辛福、李子柒好厉害。
When are you going to download your next vlog/video? We're waiting...
She is an angel!!! Congrats!😘❤
Tanta uva recoge que suerte.. por cierto el título en español del video esta mal traducido me parece
i absolutely adore how she got the camera guy and (who i assume) another member of the crew, to sit down and eat with her and grandma.
This life looks so peaceful but I'm far too lazy to achieve it 😂
Amazing and inspiring Love you♥️
Chúc mừng bạn thanh công lợi noi rất hay
I'd Love to be her apprentice for a few years she's Amazing lots of Love from Ireland 🇮🇪❤☘
böyle yetenekli bir türk kızı bulduğum gün evlenirim :))

Nature vibes love from India 😋🔥
Other vloggers who have a new phone: "oh my phone is new! Its so beautiful and expensive!"

Liziqi: "as long as its still working , i don't need a new one"❤🙏



Down to earth👑❤
Oltre ad essere bellissima sei proprio una grande donna, complimenti per tutto quello che fai 😘

I was like "what could someone do with watermelon? So boring!"... LiZiqi: "hold my wine"
太佩服了，生活智慧王☺️☺️

A true dream life, i wish i got to go to heaven so i can ask god to gave me this kind of life in there haha
Amazing!!!😊😊😊
Strength, Independence , intelligence, beauty, hard-working..
True feminism.
Well, this is how our ancestors used to live and we wonder how they were more satisfied with life than we are...
Truly happiness lies in seemingly little and tiny things of nature.
love the way she closes the door LOL 😂😂

Chúc 2 bà cháu nhiều sức khỏe, hạnh phúc và bình an...không biết nơi bạn sống là ở đâu ? Đây là nơi tuyệt vời nhất thế giới.....mình ở Việt Nam con gởi lời chào
А почему яичко не съели, перепелиное, мы так жаждали узнать с скорлупой едите их или нет
3:36 Why I see Ziqi is like a kid in this scene, laughing and running to her grandmother. It’s so aesthetic, romantic and artistic like a scene out of a movie.
子柒真棒！葡萄种的真吸引人
Such a peaceful life
Пысық озі🤗♥️👍
怎么老外这么喜欢看我们的乡村生活啊😂
I wish to marry a woman like you. ♥️ From indonesia
My grandmother very love you. She is 79 years old but she watches you everyday. Thanks for your video and i love you too. Your video make me peaceful and love my life more than ever .
Cuando probaremos tus platos favoritos en el salvador
In this isolated environment, she knows exactly what to do on so many things and yet she is so young. It looks too "natural" to be true.
Я бы к ним в гости съездил бы😌😌😌😏😏😏
Beautiful, I don't have a word to describe.
My dear liziqi my inspiration
Интересно, почему у них всегда маленькие щенки, всегда разные,а взрослых собак не видно.  Куда они исчезают, когда подрастают?
Hy vong co ay se som tro lai ❤️❤️❤️💕💕🥰🥰🥰🥰👍👍😍😍😍😍🌷🌷🌷🌷
We westerners have to learn to use more every part possible of fruits, meats and vegetables - this video according to watermelon is valuable lesson of that too - I got very good lesson endeed - we talk about "reducing" waste, but do far too little for it...
Her grandma will live longer with such care.
💕🎬 💪🏻💪🏻 well done.
SO würde ich auch sehr gerne Leben weit Weg von den Städten die mich jeden Tag anwidern aber leider bin ich hier gefangen wie viele andere Menschen auch.
每次看到發芽好高興。
Guo Zai gonna be in the pot someday😭
She’s the type of girl that never waste a single part of fruit.
Beatiful 💕
Master Piece 😘😘😘😘
mẹ ơi con muốn cưới chị này làm vợ :D
Отлично!!!!!
เก่งจังเลยครับ
8:48 A broken phone screen... Her gratitude to nature is perfectly displayed - conservative and sustainable. No wonder she is loved by many.
lucky for her to have a wide land for a garden. wish to have a estate like that...
She is the most talented person i have ever seen in my life
I'd love to marry a woman like her. 😍
看到你的手机都摔成那样了还在用，真的是节俭的女孩子。发自内心的尊重你，佩服你。加油！

Is there anything that Li Ziqi cant do? and the adorable grandma. love them.
She's the perfect example of an angel. She's beautiful, takes care of her family, she's deadly strong,multi-talented... I mean what's there she can't do!!!
Ох какой красивый набор из невероятного стекла или хрусталя! Как будто из-за льда сделан!
She is a very strong woman. This is not easy. It hard back breaking work but worth it. I am glad she happy and making money as well.
Dari sini saya belajar bahwa setiap membuat makanan istimewa membutuhkan waktu yang sangat lama & sangat detail. Ia adalah wanita sangat yg rajin. Aq padamu mbak
Wow🤩🤩
для меня в женщине 2 главное чистая кожа и волосы
I can’t believe she made a dumpling out of Watermelon rinds.
She's the most talented and hardworking person I've ever seen. Now, I'll have to atleast get up and make my bed.
I love the is so much 😭😭❤️🌸💕

I love her videos, her skills and grace. Can someone tell me what kind of oil is used in their frying? Just curious because I want to learn how to stir fry as well. And I will learn how to use chopsticks. It's a joy to watch her and her grandmother!
This girl is one of the most fascinating and impressive people alive I think. Anyone agree?

Tr: 
        Have you noticed the notice from YouTube? After September 28th, the function of "subtitles made by viewers" will be closed. I guess it will be the official unified production of video subtitles in the future.
        So, this is probably the last time I have translated Li Ziqi's video in the comment section.
        Haha, thank you very, very, very much for your recognition and love of my translations these few times. I am really surprised and very happy. Thank you everyone!
        In Li Ziqi's 10 most recent videos, I participated in the submission of 7 works for subtitle production, and the review of these 7 submissions was passed. This means that the subtitles I made are viewed by Li Ziqi's more than 10 million fans...Oh! Haha I am really lucky!
 
        Thank you again for your love of my non-professional translation.
        Goodbye everyone, I am glad to meet you, and I am glad to like Li Ziqi with you together.
        Love from china, 
        Your friend,
        Li Xiang,
        September 14, 2020, 9:50 PM
        Thanks thanks thanks everyone.❤


        Updated at 9:12 am on October 6, 2020:
        I found that my subtitle submission was published. Is this a little contribution to Li Ziqi channel?
        Haha, I am so happy, thank you!
!!Amó tus videos!!  transmites tranquilad y bondad se ve que trabajas mucho
Очень позитивное видео. Полнейшая гармония во всем. Прекрасная природа, великолепно организованный быт и деятельность человека на земле. И на фоне всего этого просто красивая молодая женщина спокойно и уверенно делающая миллион самых разнообразных дел. Такой фильм хорошо успокаивает и  заряжает энергией любого человека.
Grand ma is very lucky. Is there any vacancy in your video 😀
19:14-19:18
Grandma lost in her own memories back then.Liziqi "you were literally making your grandma to time travel in to her own past through the delicious food everytime you bring to the dining table. Everyone of us see food at the table but for her grandma each dish was a MEMORY instead. 🤗
I miss her so bad :(
This video is a video that will clear your mind!💖
Glad to see people from different countries and regions love this video
I want to come stay there and learn from you. You’re amazing! Thank you for sharing your pockets of peace 🌸
It's awesome
She really makes a lot of work look easy.
شي جميل جدا
That's amazing place, wanna see a tour rounds your garden. Who's agree with me?
Cuando termine todo lo que está pasando, irse a pasar un largo tiempo en un lugar como ese debe ser una experiencia muy relajante y única! Me encantó el video!
Умничка, какой праздничный стол!!!
瓜间一壶酒，笑填满步藤，逮秋入蔓雨，丰得枝杈甸
Very nice meals Liz was preparing,look so scrumptious and decadent delicious and yummy to food to eat especially with a wine 🍷 goes with their special meals for the night.

Amazing
Who knew you can eat watermelon peel? I always learn new things watching these videos. Even though a lot of the foods I’m not familiar with, it all looks delicious and I’d love to be there to taste it.
This is so fun
When I achieve this kind of life, I would never ever be more satisfied.
Really beautiful and inspiring 
Very natural and hard working

And more nature🌿🍃🌿🍃🌿🍃
And home made dishes 🥳🥳👌👌
So I connected to this a lot.
i love how she doesntt waste any food..not even the waternemon rindes
喜歡這一集最後面攝影師入鏡頭拿麵包跟酒，最後為了要衝過去一起敲杯鏡頭還歪了鏡頭，很有真實感，一直都好羨慕攝影師天天有美食吃啊！
Magnifico 👏👏😍
ước mơ của mik mà cj ý giỏi quá
Watching this with a cup of tea is so soothing 🥰

She is not someone who just wish and pray for a life in paradise, she create her paradise I sincerely appreciate you and will do my best to follow your example. I will work hard to achieve my dream life and not my weight or money status or age will stop me.
How large is their property?
Она не только красавица, но руки золотые!!! А как её зовут? Кроме русского я другого языка не знаю 😥
А сколько у неё энергии ,просто в голове не  укладывается 😍
👍😍🌹🌹🌹
Love her camera man... So dedicated so skilled.
Sáng tạo nhiều món ăn ngon độc lạ hay thật 🖤😋
If I could choose a life, it would definitely be this one 😁
She is the only one who could survive a zombie apocalypse all by herself .....
Свежо,жизнерадостный! Спасибо!☺
Village life is so pure 💖 love from Nepal 🇳🇵🙏🏻

Tech is invented so that we can peacefully live a life like this...tech + this lyf  ❤️
මේ වගේ නිවසක ජීවත් වෙන්න තිබුනා නම්
Does anyone miss the little lamb that would follow her around the whole day?
no? just me? okay!
Pengen tinggal disana ,sangat alami,adem dan pastiny indah sekali. ❤️

السلام عليكم اختي  تبارك الله عليك  عطينا شي وصفة لتطويل  الشعر 🙏🏻🤗
I'm curious where she got those glass cups. They're pretty nice looking.
I like the running and playing liziki through her gorgeous  and beautiful garden 🌱🥀🌴🌿☘️🌻🌷💐🌾
doctor: “you have 20 minutes and 33 seconds left to live”
 
me:
Simply outstanding 👏👍
I love this kind of life. Simple yet so healthy and happy. People nowadays are too busy they forgot to enjoy life.
Đã lâu rồi không thấy bạn ☺️
很棒的手藝, 讓人受益良多  真棒
👏🇺🇦🥰🌻
I love the way she turns her old phone, it shows the natural rusticness of the country people, doesn't follow or care about the rapid change of the world.
Legal estes vídeos, mostra o que se pode tirar de uma terra tão pequena. No Brasil agente ver o índio com terras tão grandes e  não planta nem um pé de tomate, vai para cidade vender arte para comprar comida
I always look on FB and now I found on YouTube I really like watching this show
快进好好玩😂！
Men: women have to stay home watch the kids etc
Liziqi: proof them wrong 
Ps:women can do anything and achieve everything massive respect to every women ...........wishing you and your grandma a healthy life love you xoxo❤️
เห็นละมีความสุข
fun fact: the white part of a watermelon rind tastes like cucumber
Even the music is so soothing, so good food, yummy
If I was there I'd never going home😂 what she dose is beautiful
Liziqi ang taray mo talaga sa hacienda mo
Wow, what a beautiful life😍😍
Liziqi....where are you...!!! Really missing you
Can you imagine living in this world like this everyday 😳 this way of living simple delicious and carefree 😩😩😩
I am in love. This is a great show with a pretty capable and happy woman.
🥺 when she finished the arches and jumped around calling her grandma
Selalu suka liat video nya, langsung bikin pengen tinggal di desa dan bercocok tanam😂
This is the life I want.🥺🥺🥺
我也開過農耕車，差點掉下溪底，幸好橋墩過高，我關車才翻車。很輕，無壓傷我，只黑青而已。皮膚白很快恢復了。撿到一條命，我開始買輪椅給張忠人。花將近三萬，還匯一萬給忠仁雖然他已中風死。但中義也有小孩紅包。
This music is awesome 🙏.Lots of ❤️ to you from India.
就是愛看李子柒
Little LiziQ your home is heaven on earth. Stay free from the crazy world we live in.
田园生活总是看着别人那么美好，没人相知相守也会太过于平淡
U're a strong gurl! Keep spirit!
Waiting from u r videos
Sis
人生最大的享受也不过如此,年紀輕輕卻有一身好本領,好響往这种生活
Selam tebrik ederim beceriklisin
Ziqi, how about "the life of apple" or "the life of jasmine" ? 

Well, in my thoughts, they would gonna be so interesting...
この方って食べ物とか材料余すことなく使うって感じでめっちゃ良いよね
Omg seeing the presence of a cameraman for the first time i feel so vip xD
从来没有这么近看到李子柒 感谢
Love from Bd. You proved happiness can find anywhere. Wherever you are just make it beautiful.
Nice videos
Gordon Ramsay : I want fresh grapes and watermelons!

Liziqi : Don't try me young man ...
美酒美食，令人羡慕啊，在荷兰都吃不到。好想去liziqi家乡看看啊！
Me watching to her channel at home for 12 hrs straight. Wanted to do the same but feel so lazy.
Planet Earth’s Sifu, we can learn about how to truly live as humans on this planet through her
Вы, Красота!
She have a very good gril and strong man I love it 😍😍😍❤️💗😍
She is like a fairy ❤️
奇怪的⋯⋯令我想起一個名叫藍妮妮的小女孩👧
“Your life is not a movie”
Shows Liziqi’s channel
Also, why am I dumb enough to think the peppers are there for decoration?
Enjoyed the video so much!!!
多才多藝˙充滿活力充沛˙給予人有療癒的感染者力˙
I wanna marry this woman lol
妳的生活，就只屬於妳的生活。不論外面怎麼說，多的都只是豔羨。加油，你很棒！
Girl power ❤️❤️❤️
So we aren’t Talking about how the camera man literally ran everytime she offered him something?
Bc honestly same
融化自然，生活，手作，藝術，生態集大成，難怪會是千萬人想娶的老婆☺
I’m in love with this woman🥰

If China had a tourism program where you get to stay at her house and live her life for two weeks I’d pay to go for sure
I miss you liziqi ^-^
You're so hardworking women..❤️
  Love from pakistan
In a zombie apocalypse, we’ll all starve and kill each others while this lady drink home made wine and eat 8 course meal with her grandma. If we are lucky, she can build a new civilization for us from bamboo sticks.
Liziqi: are we done filming
Cameraman guy: time to feast boys
對這樣的生活讓我覺得好感動
The most promising food blogger!!!!!

Very hard-working woman🙏💐
❤❤
I really need it after a long hard day, thank you ...
холодец, пельмешки
For Her, hard work is the way to find happiness.
I am a bit confused. Where did Li Ziqi get the grape plants from? Were those the one she pulled out from the field at the beginning?
She just made me realize how lazy i am 🤦🏻‍♀️
I love watching her she is my insperation
I want this to be my life
You are a very beautiful woman 💖 🇧🇷
🙏事事好因缘🙏

🙏🌸付出无所求🌼🙏
Yunnan alive!! Always enjoy these videos.
I am sure, the moment of bed time, she will quickly fall asleep. Such a hard working girl.
I wanna live like this. Such a heal. We all live in a mess without nature
She is strongest woman and very hard working 😍🤩😌
很可爱的女孩
I think  her crews are more excited n every new delicious dish that she prepare 

Than their salary😂😂👍🏻👍🏻
I'm sorry. I enjoy your struggle with the titles of your videos ❤
it’s like coronavirus skipped this whole thing and quarantine isn’t even real
Someone please tell me where I can get a primary fermentation container like that!!!
She's a multi- talented girl.
❤️
Go ahead dear❤️
🥰🥰🥰
Pengen hidup berkebun kayak dia😭
You are so beautiful, good, diligent girl.
It's like she's living in a historical drama...
Bình yên quá , love from 🇻🇳
Anyone else feeling her grams is aging reverse...
Must be the wonders of liziqi's company..
Saya senang dengan video liziqi orang nya cantik imut dan saya suka dengan cara memasak nya 👍👍👍
Quá tuyệt vời tôi thấy bình yên. Thật cảm động
While we were hunkering down in fear and hoarding toilet paper, she was creating a grape arbor and planting watermelons. . .
how vast is her land? please her farm is so amazing
This is the luxury of life that God gave us , that many wants to destroy 🙏🏾
15:07 she is so strong that she can break a walnut with her hand 😲

Le me: throws the walnut from 10 floor to break it😂😂
这就是我们说的世外桃源，最美好的生活，远离一切烦恼，只做喜欢做的事情
LOVE YOU ALL GUYS FROM BANGLADESH
AMAZING, JUST AMAZING
🥰🥰🥰🥰❤😭love youuu
Liziqi, you seem to be so knowledgeable at your young age, and very busy. ~ take care~Doyce~USA
Nice!!!
me watching her like : 
why is she so productive 👁️👄👁️
세상에 어쩌면 이리도 사랑스러울 수가
있으며 어찌 이리도 아름다울 수가 있나

난,
이보다 더 예쁜 사람은
앞으로도 보지 못할거 같아.
her life is more fulfilling than mine. All I have time for is just to work and make money for someone who doesn't care about me.
Can u adopt me? I wanna eat home cook like that everyday too
Your place seems to be so quite and peaceful
哇！你太辛苦了
The luckiest people in the world is Liziqi’s crew!
amazing 😍🤩
Me, watching her crack walnuts with her hands:

 👁️👄👁️
Bình dị tới nỗi ko bình thường. Nhiều đất đai để trồng cây quá😆
Xem video của Liziqi chảy hết nước dãi
Oh god i miss her so much
Legal na natureza as flores natureza 👍🌸🌸
魅力的な女性は何と大工さんであった！ソレだけではない、果物のクリエーターでもある、しかも別嬪さんである、他は　わかんないですがそれだけでも凄いです、アジアの女性は凄いですよ！？ｗｗ
Everyone : She is a gifted Chinese princess..
.
.

Me : Can I dine in with You..Please...🙏😭
This is just wow😱😱😱😱❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️♥️♥️♥️
My mouth is watering 🤤🤤🤤💝💝💝
Which kind of meet u use  dear 💕
I can't believe. She is so strong and also beautiful 😍
春种秋收，有山中客。
隐逸稚趣，醺然自飨。
I still can't believe she's human being Ike us in this era.
Ooh 😮 nice farm 😊
Very hard working and wonderful woman peaceful life
我喜歡!
Jadi pengen kesana kaya nya sejuk adem rame suara binatang
❤️❤️
She's God's special and favourite child. She's living a heavenly life. 🙏
Liziqi keknya ga pernah belanja buah ama sayur deh, semuanya ada d kebun huhu lengkap sekali
I live in America....I wake up every morning hearing the sound of cars....And going to sleep every night hearing the sound of chopper.I want to visit your village.......It’s so soothing..........
I love your voice soo much liziqi sounds as beautiful as a big pipe organ at a big cathedral!
You are amazing beautiful strong woman 🥺
我真的好喜欢你
a truly productive woman
Grape yum😋
world : no one is perfect 
liziqi : hold my granny
Liziqi and Dianxi are my superheroines on YouTube!
根本就是神造的太神奇了樣樣都會樣樣精就不容易真的很了不起我的標竿每當看了他的節目心中有無大的聲音感動丶是一位全能長得如此仙女般又有一顆善良內心完美的女人獨一無二世界上找不到像子柒這樣的仙女實在真是太厲害
❤️❤️😘
Your life is truly a paradise!
Very nice beautiful
People : So what thing that you are capable of?

Li ziqi : Yes
اتكلم عن الوذافة ولا الكياته ياربييي😭😭😭❤️
Very beautiful.
她只是中國農村 的一位小姑娘，把自己的 “小家小院打理的如此丰富多彩” 就引起了外國朋友响往，
如果這些外國朋友，來到中國一看，中國今日的成就，就會 “樂不往返 ”。她的功勞不小呀。
Anh quay phim đáng đồng tiền bát gạo quá. Cảnh quay đẹp thật sự luôn
Man who? Cuz she don't need one thats for sure...she's the embodiment of a strong independent woman who's intellect can soar above the clouds...not only is she beautiful,intelligent, and filial but her inner strength brings out her elegance, making her as if she's not from our world
I can't believe. She didn't even waste those watermelon peels.
I'm proud if I do laundry and  dishes in the same day...
This was one of my favourite episodes, wow. I am amazed by how she prepared the watermelon. Also, the pork broth reminded me a lot of Tonkotsu broth. I wonder if this could be one of/or the dish from which it evolved from.
Очень сомневаюсь что обычные китайцы так живут и готовят....такое там себе могут позволить богатые люди....
G bs berkata-kata bener2 terpana saya melihat video liziqi ,best
🍇👌👍
I think it's so funny how liziques husband walk in the picture, hahaha.
a peaceful and more livable life.  Why be busy with friends and work?
I like this kind of content, no drama or other bad things, just pure peace and clamness. love it!
روووعه ❤😊🤩🌷😍😘😘😘😘
Does she have cameras set up literally everywhere? Like really good cameras? Everywhere?
日本の里山も綺麗ですが。中国ではスケールが違いますね。
原風景、大事にしたいです。お互いに。
Beautiful place mam
I Miss you liziqi,where are you 🥺🥺
I love how she motion the camera man to join them on their feast..she's so kind 😍😍😍
Your place is heaven
아름다운아가씨가  너무나잘합니다
사랑해요💜💜💜💜💜
挺有趣，西瓜皮用来做菜，又学到了。只有一点不喜欢：那个厚厚的老菜版，既用来切生肉，又用来切熟食，包括凉拌蔬菜？是不是不卫生？
👏👏👏👌♥️
Ciao brava 😘🤗🌟💖
I love when she shares her food with the film crew and more people other than her grandmother :)
ഒരു എനർജി തരുന്ന വീഡിയോ ആണ് 😍❤️❤️❤️
I really like how this is so relaxing to watch! This reminds me of historical chinese dramas that I've watched, where there is not much modern technologies being used, and making food without using ovens, and of course, when having delicious homemade meals right in front of you, don't forget the wine. Love it so much! :D
This is one of the best examples of the phrase "for the love of labor!" She feels happiness in doing everything herself and why not, must be such a great feeling to be self-reliant. She is truly independent!
What I like the lost about this, is that there is no waste at all, she used every single part of the watermelon , and that is beautiful !
Даже арбузные корки сожрали
The best part of her videos is that she's doing many things together...she's a multitasker🌼❤👌👌
🌸💖
Liziqi's grandma is so lucky to have such a great grand daughter
I wish I can see videos like this from all over the world.  Someone who lives off of the land and,  grows their own food and raises their own live stock and is completely independent of the food grid
I actually really want to taste Liziqi's cooking - I don't think I've ever had many of the things she's mixing together! So beautiful as always <3 thank you for sharing
Perfect
Adorável!
Comida então só fico na vontade de experimentar!
Tudo muito lindo e caprichado. 
Parabéns!
Vc é demais!
i miss this girl :(
I love that she was sharing with the camera guy. 

Also, I got some late-season watermelon in my garden, almost ripe. Didn't realize how many uses there were for the rind. Might have to try making some into pickles!
I have been watching her since she had around 900k subscribers. Her videos always inspire me, such a strongest independent woman ❤️I don’t understand why so many dislikes here...

Love from 🇳🇵
Лизиги Вы прелестная лесная Фея;; Вы настоящая Веста, одно наслаждение и нервоуспокоение смотреть и видеть с какой любовью и умением у Вас всё легко получается, спасибо.
Wow. She really didnt need a man hahahah 😆
Love the abundant fresh garden produce, beautiful and healthy life style everyone dreamed of. Respect to her hardwork!
加油子柒
always looking forward to seeing your adventures. my most favorite part of each video is you loving on your grandma 🥰 God bless you all 🙏🏼
If Liziqi just sat in a flower garden and only moved her eyes, I'd still watch her videos. :)
my son is born one month ago
i'm very stressed about his birth
your vids bring me the calm and the serenuty i need to live this moment

thank you to be who you are

xiéxié Liziqi
She is the strongest woman 💪💪
Tại sao cái gì con củng biết làm tấc cả .. hay quá .. như 1 người đàn ông kg bằng con đâu  ( tuyệt quá con gái ơi )
World's strongest women 💪💪💪💪
DARI INDONESIA ILOVIYOU LIZIQI🙎‍♀️🌹🌹🌹SUKA SEKALI NONTON CHANELNYA MESKIPUN DI ULANG2..
Where are u ? We really miss u , hopefully u are fine ❤
Just found this woman's channel so positive and peaceful it's encouraged me to grow fruit and vegetables and eat healthy, I would love to live in an outdoor environment like that
Gràcies, content de tindre noticies teves, dolça feina la teva es, no deixis mai de sonrriura.
Your a doll baby !! 💎 💒
Our country women e should learn  something  from her....🤗....
aku bingung banget, ini yang jadi kameramen nya itu siapa sihh? k-kok bagus banget pengambilan video dari sudut pandang yang tak terduga. Speehless parahh karena sebagus itu, aku jadi ingin bikin video dengan pengambilan seperti ini. Ga bikin bosen tapi lama-kelamaan aku ngantuk liat videonya sebab begitu smooth...
모든 것이 혁신적
she does it in such a serene way, that it seems to be simple, but when I try to make mistakes or step over the edge the things.

congratulations Liziqi, you are amazing
🙏🙏🙏👏👏👏👏❤️👍👍👍
You are so strong woman
I prouder of you
I like your videos mam
Человек будущего !
Planet food!
Lately I was busy doing home renovations, and feeling very tired. Seeing you do so much work everyday and enjoy it, gives me inspiration.
Thank you ziqi, you show me there are so many things one can complish.
Strong women💜💜
Such a great video, just found in my YouTube recommendations. 

This is great example how people can live in harmony with nature.
I'm a new watcher and your videos are amazing! The food u make looks delicious and beautiful! Thank u for sharing your life with us. Much love from NH
You are so amazing, skillful, hardworking, and passionate about life. I love these type of videos. It calms my soul and reminds me of the real world that I'm missing
a dream, a mirage
Você é incrível e muito talentosa
Parabéns 🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷🇧🇷
❤️❤️
Grandma looks like she’s not aging at all thanks to the wonderful care and food she’s getting ♥️♥️♥️
我也喜欢田园生活，在田间跟大地接触是非常滋养的，体力会锻炼的特别好，心会很平静。这跟平常的农民还是区别很大的。一般人放不下城市的烦杂，要不就会很期待这种生活，要不就质疑这种生活。
Amo estos videos, algún día quisiera poder visitar un lugar así de  bonito y practicar muchas cosas.
Найдите ей мужика, не нормально, что красивая девушка тратит свои силы на мужскую работу ;)
The background music and scenery always reminds me of those lifetime movies.  Great Job editing.  Love your videos ma’am. You make life look easy to live.
beautiful
She makes everything look simple and wonderful,I`m in love with her.
When i saw ur videos i feel like i m in the deepest level of mine and i feel myself soo relaxing in stressed full suituation i saw ur amazing beautiful videos and i felt sooo stressfree...so thank you very much...love from INDIA❤️

Con gái giỏi quá cái gì cũng biết làm
You're probably the best ambassador China could have at this moment of time.

Amazing videos as always.
Parabéns, Que Jesus  ilumine  mais é mais vc...muito lindo ver uma jovem talentosa!!!
Such a peaceful life that makes me tearing. Hope Ziqi would just ignore the comments from haters. Wish her the Best. Happy Chinese New Year ❤️
She always gives everyone else their share first before contending with what's left for her. This girl is so generous and so giving. She deserves all the good things that came her way. I am in love with her.
Wow ! Liziqi  UR style , skill is awesome. The place U live with nature, decoration with vegetables, fruits, spices  animals is really natural. The alcohol brewing is nice to see . Love the video.
I miss her😢
Just watching this made me tear up ❤️🙌 what An amazing woman.
👍👍👍
I am just in love with your channel. You have completed you goal with me to have something to relax to at the end of the day. I just love to watch you create dishes that not only look beautiful but I best taste great. I wish everyone could live like this in the world. This is how our great God intended for us to live. He gave us everything we need right here all we have to do is cultivate the earth and let everything else take it's course. Keep up the good work!!! Love from Washington DC!
J'adore c'est trop magnifique 🤗👍
Дорогая Лидзыци❣ Вы очень вдохновляете! Жизнерадостные и романтичные видео !
天才‼️
Es hermoso ❤️
Love from india
I really feel so happy every time her grandma appears
i swear, her cameraman and crew have to be the most well fed staff out. 😊 im not jealous at all 😂
I'm so inspired by her level of self reliance....life goals😉
❤❤❤❤
Liziqi, the warrior of fruit, vegetables, super videos, and all things cooking.
So Nice
she is such a hard working young woman .. full of knowledge beyond her years .. luv this channel
She's living the life i dream to live💕
She's very humbled person, hardworking, gorgeous and a loving lady to her mom.. She have millions of subscribers, but unfortunately she doesn't want a cozy things to buy as you've seen her mobile she never changed it.. Unlike the other vloggers they buy expensive things just to show their being materialistic.
我是台灣人，妳的靜 慢 幽很吸引我！
繼續加油～認真維持初衷 忽視偽善的人言！ 因為你是用行動證明自己的。
A moça e o local são muito belos! - Aproveito para agradecer à Grande China pelo envio de vacinas ao Brasil! - Amo todos vocês!!!

Wowww!  So glad my toddler can watch and learn from a strong and skilled girl!!  Thank you!

Can we take a moment to awe over the fact that on top of all she does, she just cracked a bunch of walnuts with her bare hands??
Her Garden is so beautiful ❤️❤️❤️😍
Thank you for making us realise luxury is not the only way to live happily !!
Ресторан надо открывать. А где мужчины? Как гармонично и спокойно и мужчины не нужны.

Chinese girl working hard❤️❤️ from 🇻🇳
i had no idea that so many different dishes could be made from water melon peels. i didnt even know you could eat them at all!
I love when she tells the other people to come in and enjoy the meal and then they sprint in 😭 i would do the same! 🏃🏻‍♀️🏃🏻‍♀️
I am just wondering where and how she learnt all these skills . It’s truly incredible
Such a peaceful life. Love from Canada.

This is a way of life, skills are taught for living, nature is beautiful, this channel is a big defenition of the beauty of nature.
Intelligent, skilled, strong, resilient, and beautiful...  You are an excellent role model for young women
Can I spend a holiday in your house house so that I'll get to experience having these kind of meals everyday... oh my... such an isipiration
😍😍😍
Добрый день! Привет из украины. Давно подписана на ваш канал захожу сюда и отдыхаю,  приятная музыка и талантливая девушка. Пусть ваш канал процветает. С уважением Наталья.
❤️
Я каждый раз удивляюсь как они всему находят применение , в готовке , в быту - без отходное производство
I love to watch her videos... 😍😍😍forever my dream is to live like this.. ☺😔
If she does the videos and all the work / acting by herself, then she is my Super-Hero, Wonder-Woman, Super-Woman and Miss Universe, all rolled into one. 😳 If China clones a few million Liziqi's, they can take over Planet Earth and everyone would willingly surrender.
이뻐요
Off late, I have been coming across more and more people commenting about how Liziqi doesnt do all the work or how they call the videos fake. Well, I do not know if they are correct or not. All I know is that I have learnt a lot about a different culture. I really appreciate the beautiful production quality of these videos and they taught me a great deal about videography in general. Liziqi's food is like some magical alchemy to me; I wouldn't dare to follow her tutorials but the dishes look amazing. These videos calm me down and they have helped me deal with some highly stressful times. And all of this, in the comfort of my own space, without paying anything, I am thankful for that.
❤
i love when the cameraman runs out to get food and drink
Maravillosa y hermosa mujer trabajadora
An extraordinary lady. And a brilliant cook.
💚💚💚💚
Quisiera una mujer así, inteligente, creativa y con mucho empuje
Liziqi...where are you, i miss you 😘
I wonder, why there's a people who clicked dislike to such a wonderful vlog and amazing woman like this....
這位小姐太棒了!生活那樣超讚!
She know many seasoning and how to cook everything. Im so jealous,proud, and want to learn from her.  And she know "andaliman" in north sumatra this seasoning very famous. When cook pork, it will very delicious and spicy but you must mash the andaliman. 👍👍😂😘😘
we can all agree that we want a life the same as hers.
Really it's amazing 😊❤❤
😍😍😍😍😘😘😘😘
Behind success there is hard work ..lots of love from sikkim 🇮🇳
