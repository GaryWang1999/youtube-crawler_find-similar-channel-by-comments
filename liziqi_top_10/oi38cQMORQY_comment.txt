The basket weaving needs an episode on its own! So beautiful thank you for sharing your many talents
She is so amazing, Smart, Beautiful

Eu vejo seus v√≠deos para descansar a mente de outras leituras densas e reflexivas. Seus filmes s√£o como b√°lsamo. Delicados de come√ßo ao fim. Muito obrigada, Liziqi!
I love how she take care of her grandmother ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
The way she made a basket out of that leaf was incredible!!! 
BTW, her video makes me hungry ü§§ all those delicious food üòã
She is such a caring granddaughter. She works so hard that she could probably finish all the meatballs herself, but instead she pushes it into her grandmother's bowl.

I love it when Liziqi makes a whole dinner using the same fruit or vegetable (like cucumber here). How can you take something and cook it with soup, rice, noodles, meat, fondue, maple syrup waffles, literally everything - and the whole meal is unique and tasty? It's amazing.

Lots of love from Russia :)

You are very hardworking and very talented.  Your grandmother is also very lucky.  When I watch you, I am filled with peace.  I find the courage to move to the village where I was born.  From Turkey with love.
Bamboo fencing is good for insulation against the cold and prickly üåπ bushes great for keeping varmints away. I see her knowledge in her work.
Out of all her other 'competitors' showing similar content, hers is by far the best. Cinematography, transitions, content, quality üëå
This is such a soothing video to watch. Thanks for creating  it and sharing.
We are blessed that you got the unique idea of showing us the beautiful rustic life through your channel....üíùüíùüíù

C'est une belle maison et la dame est belle et bricoleuse ! Merci d'avoir regard√© vos vid√©os. Je vous souhaite tout le meilleur et surtout la paix. üòä
This has to be the best YouTube channel. There are so many layers to it. It‚Äôs about rural life but could easily be a cooking channel, a craft channel, a moviemaking channel. All in one. Pure poetry. She does have subscribers, she has addicts. And I‚Äôm one of them
I want a life like yours so badly
You did such a hard work‚ù§Ô∏è

Girl went mushroom picking and thought ‚Äòoh I need a basket‚Äô and legit grabbed a leaf and weaved it into a basket. She‚Äôs so innovative and skilled, she‚Äôs honestly so amazing
Such a perfect showing of life in a Chinese setting, or almost too perfect!  Interesting for sure.

Everything they eat is natural Whole Food, no processed artificial stuff like the developed societies, no plastics no pollution ‚Ä¶so Harmony and peacefulüëç
I really enjoyed your video very refreshing and I would like to say that I love Chinese people and I pray for peace ‚úåÔ∏è
The effort required to live this life is immense. Patience and perseverance beyond the average persons grasp. Yes it looks beautiful and I love watching this unique person, but most people could never do this even if the circumstances were right.
Todo mi respeto para ella ‚ô°
So amazing when she made a basket‚ù§Ô∏è
Wow she's so amazing!! I also want to be like her
Seeing Grandma laugh and smile!!! Why that just says it all!!!
I wonder what her childhood was like with her grandma <3 cooking lessons?
What she lives is the Áî∞ÂúíÁîüÊ¥ª, life on garden and yard/field. She re-incarnates the life ancient Chinese poets like Èô∂Ê∑µÊòé etc have once lived. She convinces us that a retreated life on garden and field can be so full of serenity and self-sustaining. This kind of life is a return to our inner nature, which is so appealing to many of us.

She is for me the best Youtuber in the world. Her videos are really awesome. She makes me happy. The melodies in the background are relaxing and her life is a dream. With these videos you forget all your problems for a short time and can relax.  I don't know how she does it. But thanks for that!

Hallo from Indonesia .... im happy watching your video giving me a lot of inspiring back to nature ‚ù§Ô∏è
i think her family owns that farm and they raised her well taught her well on everything. she beautiful and hardworking lady. and i guess they have people too to work in their farm like for examples planting and harvesting all kinds of vegetables and fruits in their farm. i seen her video last time she made homemade stuff from their farm i guess they were selling it in the market. not just they own the farm but they have their bussiness as well.
I watched her other videos and love the blooming flower wall üå∏ üå∫ very much and now I realized that she actually HANDMADE that flower wall herself! She blows my mind ! ü§© üòÆ

my mom suffers from dementia for years now and it's hard for her to pay attention to things.. she actually glued her eyes to your videos from start to finish.. especially when it shows finished dishes, her eyes opens wide as if saying feed me that shiet now.. i thank you..
wow amazing video love this channel such a talented women
Those who say "It's like living in a paradise", "My dream is to live like her", be careful what you wish for. It's just a wonderful picture made by a talented team, real village life is harsh af. . To do all this work by yourself you have to be physically strong and sturdy like I don't know what. She is a real hero. Real village life is only for village life" connoisseurs" : ) For starters try to bake bread for your family every day, stop buying it in a shop. Then you'll get at least a slight idea of what  village life is like   : )  And the video is exquisite.

I m sooooo jealoused from this lady , how she is soo perfect , intelligent. She can do everything thing. God bless her
looks so good just once want to eat what she cooks.
Better, more soothing, healing, soul nourishing food, lay back scenery and landscape, cooking for her grandma, hard work, teaching and silently encouraging us to copy her. Better to watch than most famous chefs we see on various videos

here i am. randomly watching her videos again . I missed you liziqi ,when will you coming back ? üòì
Aside from her obvious Goddess level skills, can you imagine how they manage the shots of every video? One day she plants cucumbers, that's 12 weeks of waiting. Surely she doesn't sit around doing nothing for 12 weeks ( for youtube content ). That means each episodes will overlap each other in one time. The editing process won't be an easy feat. I have a whole new level of appreciation for her and her team! (Hi Grandma!!! Stay safe over there and I adore you so much!!)
Que criatividade!!!
This is a woman‚ú®, who can do everything‚ú®
No Plastic, all natural, amazing taste and know how, altogether
Who else love to watch this at night because it‚Äôs so satisfying and then you realized how lazy you are but then also get really hungry when she cooked? üò≠üíÄ
For me it is very satisfying video ‚ú®‚ò∫Ô∏è
The only channel that makes me watch all of the ads, without skipping.

I love your videos, Li Ziqi. I've never seen food prepared like the way you do. I also appreciate how nothing goes to waste. For those of us stuck in a city and no skills (or space) to grow a garden, it is nice to watch how you grow your food. Thank you for sharing your life with all of us. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§

Watching this video literally brought me to tears, because it reminds of how much my mother was hardworking and dedicated with Gardening, when she was a whole lot younger. Nowadays, my mother is 77, she should be retired from her government job (but refuses to retire). My mother lives in a high-rise Condo which doesn't (obviously) have a garden. So, every Sunday, she visits, cleans and decorates my grandmother's gravestone üôè

She has a talent that she can use picture to tell a story without any words, but everybody knows what she wants to say.  Every scene in the video is just too beautiful and peaceful. When we start to ask more  and more, we even forget to appreciate what we have. We should slow down and just sit down to have a dinner with family and friends. Happiness is simple. Nice food can cure everything.
I would give anything in the world to be able to live like this.
Were all so used to having things ready for us nobody realizes this is what normal everyday life was a long time ago. Really simple , grow and prepare your food .

What do they do with all the extra food? They have a shop right? Did this grandma teach her these skills? I would be so extra proud. I wonder how many calories she burns in a day. I would probably be able to do one single thing that was involved in all the stuff she makes.. just that one thing alone not one thing per item
This girl is literally real princess that I have read in books when I was little
Real super woman. It shows conviction in hard work instead of fake adventure action and ammunition.

As an organic farmer, I don't get what all that extra bamboo wall and work was for (which was not explained in the video).  It's easier to grow cucumbers than that.  You don't need an entire wall of bamboo to grown them.  Makes for "art" in a make-believe film, though.
She always remind me of my dear parents. They're hard working farmers and I miss them so much üò¢

I love it, although it seems easy it requires a lot of work, but it is gratifying to get an idyllic life, greetings from Uruguay
HOW MANY INTERNATIONAL FANS ARE HERE FOR LIZIQI ??
WOW.. I call her "The one woman army" full of energy, knowledge and talent.
I like ur way of closing the gate üòÇüòÇ
when i look at her, i don't see a goddess on earth or a lost disney princess. i see an incredible, but very, very human, woman who has been through a ton of shit and simply doesn't know the meaning of the word 'lazy.' she's a true blue village girl, an entrepreneur, a granddaughter but ultimately someone who is just as human as us.

is she remarkable? absolutely. i don't have even half the drive or the skills she does, and knowing her story just adds to that. don't kid yourself, though: the shit she does is back-breaking. she seems to handle it easily because this is the norm for her. hell, it wouldn't surprise me if she's the type who goes crazy if she doesn't have something to do.

what's my point? don't call her a goddess, a fairy or a disney princess or whatever else you can think of. the fact of the matter is she is just as human as you or me. we can all learn to do remarkable things, but that doesn't detract from her appeal in the slightest. she's a real person, just unreachable to almost all of us. but for all we know, we might just be a li ziqi to someone else and not know it
When i was younger i can find that mushroom in my parents place but it's difficult to find now, whenever I see gardening video i feel like i want to visit my parents, harvest vegetables fruits and anything is super satisfying üòÅ
Wow, I never imagine we can germinate seeds like this. Thanks.

And your editting companies invested your. Money and you were in a legal battle. More than 1 year you are missing, your fans are really wants to know your whereabouts.. God bless you. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Liziqi Weibo Translation:

What does summer taste like?
The first breath of fresh air after you wake up in the mornings;
‚ÄúRefreshing breezes, damp air,
It‚Äôs mixed with the smell of dirt and fragrance of plants from the yard‚Äù
That‚Äôs the reply my country gives me
I think that‚Äôs pretty close though‚Ä¶
¬†
Lazing around after New Year‚Äôs is still lazing around~
I placed bamboo walls on the other three walls of my yard
Since I only did the inside for the past two years
¬†
I cut the bamboo during New Year‚Äôs¬†
I left it out for about a month, if I remember correctly
Don‚Äôt ask me why the bamboo leaves were still green after a month
I‚Ä¶don‚Äôt know how to answer that question
¬†
Around this bamboo wall,
I researched it a lot last year before deciding to use expansion screws for it
Hammer them into the brick walls before screwing it in, and choose long pieces of bamboo to place horizontally
Use some steel wire to temporarily hold it in place¬†
Wait until the entire wall is completely covered with bamboo to tighten the screws
It looks really annoying to make, but it came it pretty nice looking
Later on, I transplanted some China roses, bougainvillea, and clematis florida over
As well as a lot of cucumbers and sponge gourds
¬†
I used the traditional "soil ball" method to transplant the sprouts
Growing, transplanting, competition, blooming, fruition, ripening
I placed my cucumber and gourd sprouts
Around the inside and outside of the walls,¬†
Because I had just transplanted the flowers, they weren‚Äôt going to grow over the wall so quickly
So I placed some green vines on there so that they would look less bare
¬†
The cucumbers have been ripe for about a month now
The fruits and cucumbers have already started to grow out vines, and it‚Äôs past the season now
Remember how I was busy making the rapeseed and wheat videos?
I didn‚Äôt have time to film this
The only ones left were the local cucumbers that ripen later
Regardless of size, I picked some and dried some of the skin
Wash the cucumbers clean, then cut them in half and then into thick strips once you‚Äôve removed the seeds
Use salt to draw the moisture out of the vegetable, and then preserve it once its dried¬†
¬†
Back when I was working as a waiter in a Chinese restaurant
There was this dish called ‚Äú Stir Fry Cucumber Skin and Cured Meat‚Äù
Lots of people said that it was really good, and went along well with rice
I remember the price really clearly
It was around 2005, and the dish was 16 RMB each
That time, my salary for a month was 300 RMB.,,,
So I really didn‚Äôt want to spend a day and a half of my salary on one dish lol
¬†
Anyways, I just remember that really clearly
I guess it was a flavor that I never got to try
I‚Äôve fulfilled my dream this time by making it
¬†
After a short period of heat, there were a few bouts of rain this summer
It‚Äôs time where the chicken firs started to sprout from the forests and fields
I went up onto the mountains to take a look
And I saw the entire mountain covered in colourful mushrooms, popping their adorable heads out
With the cicadas that had just shed their skin, they announced the beginning of summer
¬†
Humid, hot; the entire mountain was filled with ferocious mosquitos
Thank goodness I was wearing long sleeves and pants
I actually found two really big clusters of chicken firs
And MingGuo (her assistant) got three huge bumps on her head from the mosquitos¬†
¬†
I didn‚Äôt take any tools, so I managed to forcefully lift them up with a branch
I didn‚Äôt take a basket, but there were thankfully palm leaves in the forest
I had to improvise on the spot, or else I would‚Äôve had to use my clothes to take them home
¬†
We usually use pumpkin leaves to wash the chicken firs
Because the small hairs on the leaves can clean the dirt on the surface of the firs
Rip the clean firs into caps and stalks
Slowly fry the caps in oil
Because this part of the mushroom has more water content
After, you can throw some ginger, peppers, Sichuan peppercorns in
Cook it until around 70% of the water from the mushroom has dried
If it‚Äôs too dry then the texture is bad, and you can‚Äôt chew through it
The oil that you fry the firs in is absolutely spectacular
You can put it in noodles, cold dishes, food in general
It‚Äôs not at all an understatement to call it a masterpiece
¬†
Rehydrate the cucumbers and then cut them into shreds
They smell great when you stir fry them with cured meat
It really does go well with rice
Super worth it after I‚Äôve wanted it for all these years hahahhahahahhaha
¬†
Pair the chicken fir oil with cucumber and soba noodles
I poached a chicken, and shredded the meat
The dish I made with them was called ‚ÄúCold Shredded Chicken Noodles‚Äù
It really hits the spot in summer!!!
¬†
There was still a bit of chicken fir left
So I cut some and paired it with cucumber cubes and cured meat
I also reheated and fried the rice from last night
The refreshing cucumbers with the umani of the firs,
With the fragrance of the rice that countered the grease of the meat
You might not believe me, but I could eat that entire dish up!
¬†
The pickled cucumbers were also made a few days ago
Cut the tender cucumbers in half and then add salt to draw out the moisture
After, dry the remaining moisture on the surface
Use peppers, Sichuan peppercorns, star anise, fennel to boil a spiced water
After it‚Äôs boiled, place soy sauce, sugar, white wine and salt then let it rest
You can add some ginger or pepper to your own taste
It tastes the best when you preserve it for around 2-3 days
Try to eat it all in a week
It‚Äôs a short-lived delicacy
¬†
I used the picked cucumbers to make a chicken roll
And I‚Äôm not going to talk a lot about it since it‚Äôs so easy to make
I got some cucumber skin
And boiled a ‚ÄúCucumber Meatball Soup‚Äù with the pork
It‚Äôs super super super super good
The minute you bite into the fragrant meatballs,
You can taste the crispy cucumber skin within the meat
The method to make these meatballs came from the ‚ÄúGreens Meatballs‚Äù I ate before
It‚Äôs crispy and fragrant
The soup is a creamy white chicken soup I made
Adorn some slices of cool cucumber
And rip some pieces of chicken firs on top
It‚Äôs such an amazing meal;
Though it‚Äôs only been a few days since I‚Äôve ate it but I‚Äôm still drooling as I‚Äôm writing this
I‚Äôm just that kind of person¬†
¬†
But remember, we only live once
Under the premise of living healthily,¬†
Eat what you want to eat, drink what you what to drink, do what you want to do‚Ä¶
Live every day properly¬†
¬†
So, my darlings
Love yourself and your family properly
Be better towards yourself.
Don‚Äôt go on diets so often! There's nothing to gain from it!
Just move around a bit more if you wanna lose weight!
¬†
That was‚Ä¶a bit offtopic
How the heck did I divert to the topic of diets
That‚Äôs all for today!
My assistant's still waiting for me to film stuff!
I‚Äôll hurry up and finish writing this message
That‚Äôs it~
Loves and kisses~~~~XOXO!!!

If Liziqi makes a video on the life of oil she‚Äôll probably build an oil rig singlehandedly first.
Don't care if there is a team behind her, what matters is what her video brings to us and what we gain from it.

I see many people comment that these videos make them feel bad for doing nothing/being on their phones, and it makes me a bit sad... Why not take them as inspiration instead?
I can't do everything she does, but since I started watching her videos I've taken up knitting, crocheting, hand-sewing and embroidery. I've planted some aromatic plants in my apartment. I make handmade gifts for my family and friends, and I visit my grandparents more often. This summer, I want to try wood carving for the first time! My life isn't quite as cool as Li Ziqi's, but I'm working on making it better... Good luck to all of you!

What a great woman - she is technically gifted, can cook super well, is very hardworking, smart and also pretty. Not like 75% of western women - oh my god my fingernail broke off, my make-up doesn't fit properly either, I'm going shopping to Zara blah blah and arrogant that it stinks like hell. With a woman like the one in the video, you tend to find similarities and enjoy the time together, you could cook together and she is also not averse to getting her hands dirty with a little craft, well and I already mentioned that she even looks amazing without Zara or acrylic fingernails.
She has all kinds of work skills. Good

N sei se eu sou a √∫nica Brasileira aqui.
Mas cinceramente amo assistir esses v√≠deos, eu acho muito incr√≠vel esses lugares, fico imaginando eu num lugar desses, sairia correndo e andando,  olhando a natureza e pensando na vida, comendo fruta do p√©, pena que aqui no Brasil n existe isso...

Aqui no Brasil,  tem mesmo √© festas baladas,  bebidas,  b√™bados e etc.   
Como eu queria que o mundo todo fosse assim...
Cuidado e com pessoas de bom cora√ß√£o.
Existem muitas pessoas ruins nesse  
Mundo que fazem mal a outras pessoas.
Alguns n t√£o nem a√≠ pra vida.
E acabam desperdi√ßando ela com coisas que n fazem sentido.
Sei q muitas e muitas pessoas que verem esse coment√°rio v√£o achar pat√©tico isso que eu estou falando...

Mas saiba que vc que ignora e n ta nem a√≠ pra esse tipo de coment√°rio...
√â porque vc n sabe observar como a natureza √© incr√≠vel.
E como o mundo seria lindo.
Se n existissem pessoas ruins.
E sabia que vc pode estar sendo errado tambem
Eu n falo de maldade,  maltrata√ß√£o e etc, eu falo de inveja e outras coisas do tipo.

Por isso eu falo.
Aproveite a vida o quanto vc pode, pois vc s√≥ tem uma.


Obs: tenho 12 anos

Gentlemen, ZiQi is rare and special. We must protect her at all cost.
Muhte≈üem üòò
Ever since I watched her vlog, I always dream of having a house like hers---home of everything.
A long time ago, Hwanung, the son of Heaven, ruled the people. There lived a tiger and a bear that wished to become humans, so they prayed everyday to Hwanung. Hwanung called them and gave them garlic and mugwort.

He said to them "you can become a human if you eat only garlic and mugwort for 100 days in a dark cave."

The tiger gave up after a little while, but the bear stayed in a cave alone. Surprisingly, she became a beautiful woman after 21 days.

Hwanung took her as his wife and she gave birth to a son. They named him Dangun. He grew up and established a country, Gojoseon. It was the first kingdom of the Korean history.

I‚Äôve also planted cucumbers but I literally got 4 cucumbers so I guess I need to plant more this year per pod and this time I will for sure grow them vertically and plant way more flowers than last year for pollinating the plants.
The amount of various flowers she has attracts so many pollinators it‚Äôs the reason her foods are so big and beautiful. 
Last year I planted a lot but my best harvest came from tomatoes from which I planted 6 different types. My second was beans and peas for which I had 3 different types. 
So I think that it‚Äôs also important to buy at least 2 or three varieties of vegetables in the same family....except zucchini one or two plants produce more than I could eat. 
I really love her videos and seeing how she plants items because I‚Äôve never done too much myself but I‚Äôm going to have a pretty food forest one day.
Superb inspiration! Thank you for sharing this video!

That's a crazy amount of work. Feeding the pigs, chickens, and dogs; planting, watering, and making greenhouses for the cucumbers and other crops; watering, fertilizing, and trimming the flower plants; making or repairing the fences, wash basins, beds, and silk blankets; not to mention cooking and doing the other household chores.

By: L.F. Young

She is a gift to this world from the god‚Äôs, and if we are wise enough to learn and see. Maybe! Just maybe, by living, loving and finding peace with this tired old world. We may yet, find the pathway to inner and outer peace.

Thank you from a weary and tired world. I pray. These sad, frustrated and lonely human‚Äôs. Find, their humanity before it‚Äôs to late, for everyone and everything. I haven‚Äôt given up on you, my children... don‚Äôt give up on yourself.

LiZiqi is a fascinating woman her talents are endless just as her love for her Grandmother and whole family this woman can do anything she decides to do. Li will research the new subject or building and once her research satisfies Li will begin with her project. I wish I could spend one full year living on the Grandmother‚Äôs farm. She makes her own tools to use for cooking.

Amazing life, live with nature & grow anything she wants to.  No headaches from any co-workers, she controls her own time, and more importantly, she is her own boss!!  Although, she is doing a lot of hard-manual work (possible someone assist her after filming), on the contrary, she is content and making millions of money from her wonderful videos.  Kudos to her:)

I would LOVE LOVE to see more of grandma, ask her to tell you stories about her growing up and what life was like, ask her to tell your viewers about her family and how she cooks food, did she teach you how to cook? Oh I pray grandma will be around for another 50 years (wishful thinking) my momma is 86 years young, grandma reminds me of my mom, so kind hearted, she loves to laugh, she rarely takes breaks and is always busy (she says it‚Äôs what keeps her alive) , I would love to know more about grandma üôèüèªüíï

It's all so perfect. She's a pretty young woman who works hard to make a beautiful life, wears a little make up, just the right clothing and has learned how to market her unique lifestyle. She makes enough food to feed a village, but it's for her and grandma. It's almost too saccharine, but it is pretty. Most of us will watch and glean little from her display. Just an impression of longing to live like this, and hope the soundtrack of our lives will be as aesthetically precious. Only a good mate will complete  her existence. Does Liziqi have room for one?

This type of mushroom in Thailand is known as a mushroom or termite mushroom. That is, add the mushrooms to salt and set aside for 1 night. Then mixed with water to boil to boil to eat or cut shallots Fresh chili is even more delicious. This method preserves the boiled food and put it in the refrigerator for a long time

Everyone saying they want this life. The environmental beautiful surrounding there is not easy. The trees the farms the life stalk everything thats beautiful requires lot of labour work on a daily basis in order to maintain it. Laziness will only ruin it. The things she does looks easy on our eyes because she is professional at what she does. Don't fool your self inorder to live this live it requires certain decipline and wisdom. Take a first step and keep a pet dog first it will take a toll on you and your responsibility taking care of it. My simple message to you is the best thing in life are the most hardest and sophisticated thing. Good luck to you all those who live the life of dedication and decipline you are the ones who will succeed on what you set out to do. Thank you people for giving your best. Libe on life it's worth it (it's beautiful).

Excellent content, outstanding videography, video editing. Excellent soothing background music, although a little melancholy at times. Outstanding culinary skills and recipes and carpentry skills. Excellent home decor and fashion sense. Wholesome family content. Excellent lessons on feminine virtues and values. God bless.
Everytime she calls her grandma pawpaw. It reminds me of my kids calling my mom that. Unfortunately she is no longer here. I wish she was still here and lived long like Liziqi grandma. Thanks for the content.

Been watching for two weeks straight, include the interview video about her childhood. Today, I realise that I have never seen much interactive between ZiQi and Grandmother. I see Grandmother is quiet and blank face most of the time, hardly see her talking to granddaughter... The more video I watch the more I feel Grandmother is a supporting role, in leading role Li ZiQi's cullinery videos. There is no bonding of a Grandmother and a granddaughter. Maybe they aren't biological grandmother and granddaughter........ Nevertheless, I do like these videos, farming, cooking, living on the mountains, unlike the urban country I live now, no mountains, no farms, no crops, only have them all in my farming game. But I ever lived on the mountains when I was a kid, visiting and short staying during school term holidays at Grandparents' Attap Leaves House. My mother watched few of these videos too, she said watching these videos bring back her memories before she got married to town.

Qu√© lindo y rico todo! Me encantan estos videos‚ù§
Farmer are always poor. But LiZiQi turns it around. She grows the foods eats the foods and shares the foods and selling her lifestyle through a beautiful dream lifestyle presentation. All the country have countryside and forest/woods, but no one will figure out the primitive outback‚Äôs living can make it viable to mankind. LiZiQi open a new horizons to the mankind.

As a vegetarian i was shocked when she showed the chicken but i like how she shows everything as it is. Everything natural. Many people eat chicken nuggets but if you would give them a whole chicken they couldn‚Äòt eat it. 
She is being real. I respect that.

Hello from Indonesia. Watch your videos, like looking back at my childhood village. Now I live in the city and occasionally return to a much different village. My agricultural culture in my country and your country is almost the same. I'm happy to watch your video. Tq Liziqi.

Really awesome, relaxing, soothing, calm. Great to see.

She should send this to Nat Geo People channel so the whole world could watch her amazing works, ü§î n wish to see who is her Mentor, üëçüëçüëç
Her beauty shines from inside to outside. And the piano sooths my soul. Preparation is primative, ads a certain flair to daily grind. Hats off to an angel that loves her grandmother.

The more videos I watch the more I think wow is this how life is supposed to be lived? Like honestly it‚Äôs cool being all modern and the convenience of buying things, but having the skill to create and environment and healthy life style for you and your family is respectable.

She‚Äôs really living, everything she needed she made, all of the food no extra anything all natural......... it‚Äôs crazy and I understand that‚Äôs something that she worked years to master but I appreciate it. I don‚Äôt want to be stuck in a box where money and status means so much that living like this is far fetched. This is true life, this is art.

This happens when you can inspect and supervise your garden in night gown on the morning dawn because you have laboured your hardwork three months before!
Never assume a bamboo fence is fragile.
The middle of the fence is a concrete she covers with bamboos on both sides.

Who else finds her way of pouring water around her glass pickle jar is very satisfying?

Even though I don't know the purpose I still enjoy watching.

My daughter introduced me to her video when she first appeared on YouTube years ago and I fell in love with her life because I'm a farmer by passion.
I don't have access and skills and luxury she has but I pray to own a chilly land to satisfy my yearning within.
In her case, my yearning is her earning.
She owns the whole vast mountain.
She can take all bamboos and leaves to her wish.

If you are new here, here is absolutely everything you need to know about Liziqi ( Li Ziyi ): 
 
In 1990, Li Ziyi fell to the ground in Mianyang, Sichuan. Her parents divorced when she was very young. Later, her father died, and Li Ziyi became an orphan. His stepmother didn‚Äôt treat her well. Li Zizhen mentioned on Weibo that he had had a half-dead experience when his stepmother dragged her hair into the gutter and was beaten.
 
Grandpa and Grandma distressed granddaughter, and finally decided to take Li Ziyu home and live. When Li Ziyi was in fifth grade, his grandfather died again, and it was difficult for his grandma to raise her to continue school. At the age of 14, Li Ziyi had to drop out of school and go to the city alone to work hard, and began an 8-year wandering life. Her first life was very hard. She slept in a park chair and scratched her head for two months.
 
Li Ziyi has also worked as a waiter in a hotel, with a monthly salary of 300 yuan. In order to earn more income, she went to learn to play discs and sang in the bar. Later, when talking about the matter, Li Zizhen frankly said: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say that I liked music at that time, just to live, I felt that it was well paid.‚Äù
 
In 2012, because grandma was ill once, Li Ziyi was worried that she would regret it later, throwing away all work and returning to grandma. ‚ÄúBeing closer, I feel more at ease.‚Äù
 
After returning, Li Ziyi opened a Taobao shop, but the business has been up and running, and he barely eats. In 2015, under the influence of his younger brother, Li Ziyi was exposed to the short video platform Meipai. Until 2016, seeing that his younger brother had some fans on Meipai, and holding more fans can improve the mentality of Taobao business, Li Ziyi re-entered Meipai to prepare for his own video program.
 
The reason why she chose to shoot videos in this style is closely related to her childhood environment.
 
In an interview with the living room of Sina Club, Li Ziyi mentioned, ‚ÄúAll these things that are self-sufficient in the countryside, for me, they are jealous. In the short video, she chose to start from the most familiar places.
 
In the beginning, Li Ziyi gave himself a topic called ‚ÄúFour Seasons Change, Eat While You Eat‚Äù. After the suggestion of Meipai editor, it became ‚ÄúAncient Food‚Äù and it is still used today.
 
In September 2016, a new opportunity came quietly, which also became an important promoter for Li Ziyu to get more attention in the future. Sina Weibo began to openly search for more outstanding short video creators for resource support.
 
As mentioned at the beginning of the article, Liu Tongming brought her Weibo resources support.
 
One day in September 2016, Li Feng, an ancient short video blogger, accidentally received a private Weibo message from ‚ÄúMr. L‚Äù. Mr. L expressed his love for Li Ziyu‚Äôs video content, felt that he had fulfilled his Taoyuan dream, and hoped to meet her.
 
For a long time after that, Li Ziyi received Mr. L‚Äôs private letter. ‚ÄúIt would be a shame for such a good video to let this person see it. This is usChina‚Äôs proud traditional culture should be seen by people in China and around the world. ‚ÄúMr. L said in a private message.
 
At first, after seeing these private messages, Li Ziyi didn‚Äôt care too much, even worrying about encountering a liar. Until one day, Mr. L came to the city where Li Zizhen was, and wanted to ask her to have a meal and talk. Mr. L‚Äôs politeness and clear logical thinking made Li slowly drop his initial alert.
 
This accidental meeting has completely changed the life trajectory of Li Zizhen. Not long after the meal was over, with the help of Mr. L, Li Zizheng was supported by a large wave of resources on Sina Weibo, accelerating her popularity and allowing Li Zizhen to rush into the queue of the net influencer on the head.
 
This experience is partly recorded in a diary of Li Zizheng that year. Some insiders close to the senior executives of Weinian Technology confirmed to Tencent‚Äôs ‚ÄúShenwang‚Äù that the ‚ÄúMr. L‚Äù is actually Liu Tongming, and his pseudonym was publicly reported. Daxiong Liu, the founder of Wei Nian Technology, an MCN company to which Li Zizhen now belongs.
 
On December 8th, the reading volume of a Weibo topic labeled ‚ÄúIs Li Ziyi a cultural output‚Äù climbed to 800 million. Li Zizheng was once again on the hot search list.
 
The video created by Li Ziyi and her has become a phenomenon worthy of study now.
 
Extensive overseas communication is an important reason for Li Zihuan‚Äôs renewed attention. Some people say that she has filmed a desirable rural life and spread the charm of traditional Chinese culture and cuisine. Others think that her video is not completely true To reflect China‚Äôs rural life.
 
Even the queries that have been popular since the explosion have been brought up again, such as being a DJ, being a rich second generation, whether the video is from my own hands, is there a strong push behind it, and the video is true for rural life It‚Äôs still just a fiction for character setting.
 
An insider of Weinian Technology told Tencent‚Äôs ‚ÄúDeep Web‚Äù that Li Ziyi was of ordinary origin, and the relevant video content was produced by Li Ziyi himself. The popularity was not the initiative of the company and himself. In fact, both Li Zihuan and the micro-reading team behind him were quite low-key, and they were very enthusiastic and declined all the current interview needs.
 
Until August 17, 2018, Li Ziyi‚Äôs eponymous Tmall store officially opened. Six days after going online, the store with only five products at that time had sales of over 150,000 and sales of over 10 million. A year later, the total sales of 21 products displayed in the Li Zizhen flagship store exceeded 1.3 million, with total sales reaching 71 million.
The value behind Li Ziyi‚Äôs IP is being quickly tapped.
 
Li Ziyi started from scratch and gained the first fans with his own strength. But now the popularity and gains of fame and fortune are obviously no longer just her achievements.
According to Tianyan search, ‚ÄúDeep Web‚Äù shows that MCN Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co., Ltd., which Li Ziyi belongs to, was established on February 28, 2013, with a registered capital of RMB 5.208 million. According to the introduction, Wei Nian is an entertainment entertainment company that incubates KOL into IP through short videos and extends to consumer brands.
 
The information of Qixinbao shows that there are more than 100 pieces of intellectual property information of the trademark ‚ÄúLi Zihuan‚Äù. The applicant companies are Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co., Ltd. The product categories include food, clothing, shoes and hats, dyes and fats, beer and beverages, Financial property management, catering and accommodation.
 
Not only that, Wei Nian also has inextricable links with Li Ziyu‚Äôs companies.
 
According to the eye inspection, Li Jiajia (should be the original name of Li Ziyu) established Sichuan Ziyu Culture Communication Co., Ltd. on July 20, 2017, and Wei Nian is its shareholder, holding 51% of the shares. Supervisor, Li Jiajia holds 49% of the shares.
 
According to other data, there are as many as 50 beneficiary companies behind Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co., Ltd., including Greenland Holdings, ZTE, Xinhua Media, Vanke, Light Media, etc. .
Among the shareholders of Weinian Technology, Sina Weibo is particularly eye-catching.
 
From Wei Nian Technology to Sina Weibo, Li Ziyi gradually has the best cards that internet celebrities are looking forward to.
In her own words, she changed from ‚Äúa little transparent to a person who is so useless to society‚Äù. After entering the public view and being noticed by more people, Li Ziyi‚Äôs sense of responsibility has also become heavier.
‚ÄúI want to do what I can to do more things that are good for society, such as the spread of traditional culture, non-heritage cultural craftsmen, and I want to show these old things to everyone so that more people know. Li Ziyi said.

Good afternoon and good health to everyone. I am truly fascinated by the whole panorama and sequence of all the videos.

To Li Ziqi:

I know many people doubt your abilities and capabilities of doing things on your own.
Many questions the content of your videos.
They doubt the integrity of your work.
Many branded you as liar,
even name-calling your work a propaganda.
But dear, please keep on doing what you do bests.
Ignore the harsh comments and focus on your work.
Don't let their doubt tarnish your kindness.
And their questions bring you down.

For all the people you've inspired to do their best.
To make something beautiful with their own hands;
To create a peaceful place filled with tranquility,
For someone you've inspired to start from scratch;
And for someone whose heart you've touched with kindness..
A single "Thank You" is not enough.

To someone who's doubting her knowledge and skills, be her videos, a reminder, that with hard work, patience, perseverance and knowledge, we can survive this cruel world.
We can create a world we dream of;
Instead of belittling her kindness and hardwork, let's try a bit harder to create something with our own hands.

There's a lot of informative videos where we can get inspiration. And this is one of them..

This isn't just about surviving,
but living the life all of us wanted.

Peaceful and tranquil.
Quiet and less noise.

Thank you for sharing your knowledge and skills...

With love,
From üáµüá≠

wow, I've been in horticulture a while but my brain just exploded.   I love the use of all natural materials and using mud-made 'seed bombs' that we often use in reforestation projects for cucumber germination and seedling care.   
Please please please write down your recipes;  I would love to try them.  Is that some kind of vinegar in the jar with the peppers and cucumbers?  Does it have soy sauce or some other type of sauce?

These mushrooms she collected are the ones that termites are cultivating. They can exist only by feeding off of their excrements. So, if you see these mushrooms, there are definitely homes of termites underneath. These mushrooms can grow up to 60 cm in diameter. Sometimes even one meter. :O

The finance is getting worst...i just lost hope..But after watching Liziqi video, i feel calmed. It give me hope.

I always see a ton of people wanting this lifestyle in the comments. You CAN have it. It's called homesteading. There's a metric giga ton of info on it all over the place if you know where to look. Animal husbandry, gardening, foraging, building/construction, preservation of food, butchering live stock, pretty much anything you can think of that people used to do that we don't bother with anymore. For the folks in North America the old Farmers Almanac and Mother Earth News are great places to start to give you an idea of what Homesteaders do.
Wow
2020 has been a really tough year for all, but Liziqi really brightens up my day and brings abit of positivity to my life. I love my life here in China and wish every one a happy life.  Thank you Liziqi

GIVE TO NATURE WHAT IT'S DESERVE, THE RETURN COME IN DOBLE. EXCELLENT VIDEO.
Liziqi- You are amazing and I love watching all of you work.  You are an inspiration.  I know this is asking for too much - would you be able to put recipes or ingredients for the food you make.  It all looks so delicious and I would like to try it too.  No worries if you don't.  Be blessed
Oh and the sequence....chickens pecking in the yard......cut to scene of dancing flowers with squak in the background....then back to scene of chicken being prepped for the pot. Great humor, point taken. Watching her videos is the best film making class you can take.
She is a master of all and as beautiful as the nature is... She is a nature Girl.
Abundance of food yet still murdering animals, sort of defeats the purpose of the paradise you live in .
She definitely have the skill on the doing those thing, but I can't believe the amount of people think this is real farmer life and she only have a assistant and a camera man.

Perfect until cutting the poor chicken! She didn't even care. Cruel!
The entire time I thought this video was about the life of a concubine. And here I thought where can I find a concubine make all those yummy dishes? Oh those wishful dreams.
ÿπÿ±ÿ®ÿü!!
my favorite part to always watch is when she eats together with her grandma ^-^ reminds me of my grandparents
Id like to see uncle roger react to this awesomeness
The planning she did for the video is simply breathless. One video took many days even months to be shoot.. can you imagine that... the diligent you need to have to stick to the schedule and shoot it.. All those preparation... I think her team must have shot multiple videos on the same days... since you know, the growth of those plants and vegetables is not easy to be replicated once it missed the timing...

Mmmm everything looks delicious, Im always wonder whats the real time that it takes you to prepare all those dishes. You should make a video about desserts in china. Grettings from Mexico.
i love your work
For those who don't know--She has been an internet celebrity in China for  a very long time. There are lots of food under her name brand. She made a lot of money. Why would some people feel sorry for her. I  tried a few food items of her brand. To be honest, it was OK to me. Maybe something else I haven't tried is good.. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Ziqi_(vlogger)
I would love to see this country and dining with this family with my family.

looking for the perfect way to commune with nature and let go of the daily life worries that are demoralizing you, go spend some time outdoors. Once you disconnect from the internet and your iPhone, take some friends with you and enjoy the grandeur and majesty of the oceans, mountains, and forests that are all around you, and then you will understand what is the best way to live life, feeling invigorated and refreshed.
You are living real life...

I see again someone says wants to visit her or garden tour.What? want to lay a finger on every beautiful thing in this world? Why would you just stay at home and being inspired by her and make your own garden, create your won peaceful life? Don't bother her, there were intruders caused her troubles before. She is a video producer who has her quiet and peaceful life, not a tour guide, and the peacefulness is what attracts so many people to her videos. Don't ruin her peacefulness. Don't make many people's spiritual home a noisy market and scenic spot. There are not so many beautiful places left on this planet that no human ever touched, human beings should learn to protect them, not being greedy to step a foot on each one of them.

After watching regularly Liziqi's videos for a while, I came to the realization that my personal response, as many others have voiced, is about her stories givng me a sense of hope, simply put. The rejuvenation, the rhythm of life, and the unfailing sunrises & sunsets, all anchor me to a world that will survive despite the ills mankind has exerted onto the environment and, of course, ourselves. Perhaps this is what draws me to Liziqi's videos.

17:45    (Tr: The conversation between Grandma and Ziqi here is a local traditional proverb. I understand the pronunciation, but I don't understand the meaning. I only know that it is some records of the elders on the crops.The young Ziqi occasionally asks her grandma with rich life experience for a lot of experience lol.)
17:55    Ziqi: Look at this, it's very soft!The whole is okra.

(Tr: My English is not very good. I have referred to translation software for many parts. Please forgive me if there is any inappropriate expression, thank you.)
 
 
 
Translator's Note:
        There are not many conversations in this video, I share a few knowledge I know:
        1. Why did Li Ziqi make this stone road at the gate of the yard? 
             Li Ziqi mentioned on Weibo that she had watched a cartoon many years ago, and there was a scene that impressed her: "A vine grows along the wooden fence toward the sun." She also wanted such a fence. So she made this road and planted flowers.(In the follow-up notes, she mentioned "As long as it is what she feels right and wants to do, then we must work hard to do it".)
        2. I don‚Äôt know if any friends feel uncomfortable with the accelerated processing of some clips in Li Ziqi‚Äôs video?
            Accelerated processing has been used in the last few videos, and I also saw a message like this in the comment area: "Your video should not use such an acceleration technique, it destroys the tranquility of the video."
            In addition, some netizens speculated that: ‚ÄúSome netizens in China questioned that Li Ziqi‚Äôs video was false. Many of the parts were made by her team and then made Li Ziqi appear on the scene. Li Ziqi told them in this way that all the processes She did it all by herself."
            For me, speeding up or not speeding up will not affect my feelings about watching the video. Li Ziqi is a very real and hard-working sister. I don‚Äôt care how many people complete her videos. She lives hard and studies hard. The spirit is enough for me to study for a long, long time.
 
 
        As always, I am sooooooooo hungry after watching her video lol.
        Goodbye everyone, I am going to eat!
        Greetings from China, Li Xiang.

        (She always updates on Weibo the first time, and then on YouTube, haha this time I completed the translation before the YouTube update.)

I hope I can stay in your house for about a month. Enjoying the life you lived, eating food you cook everyday, everything organic. 
This should be a holiday package you sell.
Hope she always happy and healthy, watching her cooking make me feel lonely but calm, idk..

I believe that it will not be long before the manager of this channel will deal with the problem of not being able to watch it.
