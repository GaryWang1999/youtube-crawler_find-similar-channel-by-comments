This video took her 9 months to make. We don't see many people pull so much effort into making a single youtube video like her. And that's why we should cherish the wonderful moment of watching it as It's the bliss and containment that nothing in the world can top with it. May the peace be with everyone who is watching / has watched Liziqi's video.
I could watch her all day and wish I could work for her; I'd work for nothing just to learn.
I never seen anything so precious as this. Her energy, beauty, humbled heart day after day with such Hard Work. This channel is magnificent. Thank you 
I love everything about this channel. The fresh produce. The food she cooks. The earthen ware she uses. The herbal tea. Everything looks delicious. She works really hard. Sometimes I wonder if it is even real. I dont know anyone who can do so many things like her. Watching her videos brings a lot of warmth to my heart.
This is crazy! How Is she able to be good at everything? : She's perfect in cooking, gardening, horticulture, housekeeping, needlework, handicrafting, etc... Everything she does seems also enough sustainable and ¬°she also wins in games in 22:18 and work as a bellhop in 14:53 !     Amazing 
You, Liziqi, are the best inspiration for all of us.
Every video is like a mini movie‚Ä¶ imagine how long just the B-roll takes to film. Truly an art putting this together. Not to mention the ACTUAL HARD WORK she‚Äôs putting forth‚Ä¶ truly amazing. One of a kind! Nature & humans working in tandem is a beautiful thing 
There are truly no words to describe these videos. Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è
I love that every time she's doing the seed planting, one of her dogs tramples their way through. It's adorable.

An absolutely enchanting production & lots of information for possibly surviving our future food shortage worldwide‚Ä¶ keep up being a wonderful model for all people.   
I can't find words to describe my feeling , or too say how much I appreciate you , your family and this wonderful video , tank you so much , wish you leave in peace and love.
She‚Äôs not only a successful farmer she‚Äôs killing it on YouTube.
So lovely to watch Li Ziqi over and over with all her work.
The pandemic hasn't affected her at all. It's like she's living in her own world where everything is peaceful and serene. Lots of love from India
Thank you so much for the wonderful videos. I've been watching them again and again. They really help reduce stress whenever I'm under pressure. In stead of watching something sad or negative, I choose to watch your videos. Your energy and dedication really cheer me up. Love you so much.
I love watching her work and seeing how she gets everything herself, she grows them herself, takes care of them and collects them. I love his farming methods and seeing how he saves everything for the winter.
Wow!! She's incredible. Minding her own business, living life in peace, enjoying nature :)

Words cannot express my enjoyment when watching these videos.   Breathtaking, relaxing, and hunger producing.  I would not be so stupid to think she does it all alone, I just appreciate the outcome.  Thank you
I am American. I live in Fort Smith, Arkansas. Most of the time, I have no idea what she is growing or cooking, but I love watching any way. It‚Äôs so peaceful. Plus I enjoy gardening and am constantly impressed with the hard work she puts into growing food. We often take for granted the labor that goes into a simple dish. I also like the way she cares for her grandmother. Respect for our elders. Respect for this channel.
Es una mujer maravillosa que fuerza qu√© imaginaci√≥n ,productiva  inventiva, muy trabajadora quiero saber su nombre de d√≥nde es
This is one of the best video I have ever seen ..... absolutely love that girl and her efforts as well....god bless you.
I hope she wins the legal battle she's going through so she can keep sharing these videos with us.
PLEASE COMEBACK LIZIQI......
We missed Your videos there are no real creativity in this world without You.
I love how rich her soil looks on the farm.  Beautiful.
She eats more variety of dishes in one year than I will ever eat in my life. So far she has never repeated the same dish - its amazing. She can come up with infinite dishes.
Uma mistura de capricho e delicadeza e for√ßa.

Behind this beutiful calm and relaxing video the credits goes to her HARDWORK.
The best part is when they dine together in their garden, talking n laughing. Always so cozy.
YOU ARE ABSOLUTLY AMAZING....!!! I HOPE YOU  MAKE NEW  VIDEOS SOON...I HAVE SEEN THEM ALL...SO FAR...YOU ARE LIKE MEDISEN...FOR ALL OF US...WHO LEAVE IN BIG CITIES...!...GREETINGS +LOVE FROM GREECE..!
You know this woman is such a great example for so many. Personally she motivates me so much to work hard myself. I don‚Äôt live in a setting like hers , I live with a city so the work and setting here is nothing compared to her but it makes me to try to learn new thinks and better myself at the way I see the world and work things around. Her videos are also an amazing escape from stress and my anxiety personally and I really thank her for that!
She‚Äôs so amazing. I can watch her all day I wish I could work for her. I‚Äôd work for free just to learn
Missing your videos Liziqi.. This is one of my favourite YouTube channel.. all your videos are my personal favourites and they are so much satisfying relaxing and giving happiness to my soul. Watching these old videos again and again..

Her video is so relaxing to watch...and I really envy those fresh and healthy veggies and fruits she has...a simple but fruitful life...
They said Liziqi has only chinese fans.
Raise your hands if your an international fans.
I love Lizqi's channel beyond compare. If I  were given a chance to go for a vacation I would certainly visit her place. It feels like paradise. How I wish this dream would come true.
Como ela √© linda!como ela sabe aproveitar tudo o que a natureza d√° de uma forma simples e elegante,e muita riqueza espiritual nesta bel√≠ssima jovem!

Wow!!  Long time no see!  So happy to know she's still doing these videos Ô∏è
Is there something that this girl can't do? I mean she's so pretty, she sings, she cooks, she designs she does everything!
She is inspire to all
I have been watching Lizqi for years, and EVERY SINGLE TIME, she astounds me. She is what dreams and books are made of.
My heart is deeply touched by watching this beautiful life recording ... so thankful to Ziqi.
She is so simple and explained life in a short video - how life is born then grown and eaten away by so many things surrounding us - she shared the beauty in making her life as beautiful as it can get - god bless
Wow me gusta este canal, amo su gente, que a√±oranza me da la vida en el campo y su naturaleza.Ô∏è
This is the most incredible cooking video I have ever seen in my life.
Thanks for making me feel so deprived.
Lol.
Loved it.
You and your videos look like a dream! All my respect and admiration!
Let's be honest: If every place look like this, this world would be a wonferful place to live without any problems.
just so wonderful how skilled she is. I would go there to learn and want to live there too
Saludos desde Mexico üá≤üáΩ primera vez que veo tus videos, me encantaron .
These videos I can watch over and over again.. so soothing for the mind
When I see this video it's feel me so much happiness. Thanks to you for your hard work on it.  From India.
her videos are awesome, I just love to watch them. But it would be much better if she could write all the recipes she cooks in the description box.
This hardworking and talented lady inspired me a lot that i was able to grow some veggies in my backyard and i was so happy when i harvested them hahaha.
Incredible work ethic, family love and honor. 
She is brave and strong and respectful of her surroundings 
Thank you for sharing  .
When she gets herself a partner I wonder what he/she will be doing. There won‚Äôt be anything left to be done. Liziqi single handedly does everything. She is a team herself. A one woman army sort of person.
Descubr√≠ este canal recientemente y aunque veo que no has subido contenido en estos √∫ltimos meses espero de coraz√≥n que todo est√© bien... Eres una inspiraci√≥n de que no hay l√≠mites que todo somos capaces de realizar cualquier cosa, adoro ver el amor que tienes a tu abuelita estoy encantada con este canal eres magn√≠fica...
Liziq muito feliz com esta vida simples de fazenda.
Uma garota muito bonita e trabalhadora. Parab√©ns.  Brazil

Tr:
        I received the notice of "Li Ziqi Update Video" last night. I thought there would be official subtitles directly this time, so I didn‚Äôt rush to watch the video...
 
        In the video, the sister and Li Ziqi grew up together. When they were young, they often played in the yard together and went up the mountain to pick fruits together. Taking advantage of the National Day holiday, Ziqi reunited with her sister.

        I'm late, sorry, haha!
        Yours, Li Xiang,

Hola se√±orita Li Ziqi, me encanta ver sus v√≠deos, he hecho algunas de sus recetas, tal vez no quedan tan ricas como las que usted hace, pero la felicito porque es una mujer muy trabajadora, sencilla, tiene mucha iniciativa, y como hace sus recetas de manera  muy artesanal y ancestral. La felicito por la vida sencilla que lleva y darme cuenta que cada pa√≠s tiene una riqueza en tradiciones que debe cuidar. Gracias y siga haciendo m√°s videos de su manera de cocinar y de esa manera tan hermosa de vida que tiene. Muchos saludos desde M√©xico.

The food looks delicious.  She is a good cook. So peaceful seeing these videos.
Your grandma is so cute!
Very cool... 
Really love her cooking, farming, and when harvesting is the best! Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è
She is such a master of creating the perfect scene. So beautiful, wholesome and calming. I sincerely hope that she will be able to get back to work and win her lawsuit.
I really admire liziqi. she is so hardworking.
She is amazing.
Hard work and blessed with so many skills
I hope we can one day see more of her videos again.
They put so much effort that is why farmers should be recognized more.
Its amazing that someone this talanted, creative and beautiful is also so industrious.
I cant stop thinking about what ONE day of her life looks like, working on all these different projects, filming it all and then later that day sorting all the clips into different folders like ‚Äúrice‚Äù, ‚Äúpumpkin‚Äù, ‚Äúpeanuts‚Äù, etc to keep it all organized and then, when she‚Äôs done putting it all together.
I can only imagine the effort that goes into her videos. She so much deserves all the subscribers and views on her videos!!!
It is natural beauty,
It's lovely
I don't have any words to express my feelings about this video
It's really really amazing Ô∏è
The place is a heaven . And I love this place very much .

Nobody compares to you. We are waiting for your return. Your classic and unique way of doing things make you stand out among the rest. Keep it up. I  pray for your safety so with your grandmother. God bless you.
She definitely has brought many things to the next level.... salute!
This is not life, this is art and life well lived.
Estou fascinado com tamanha destreza 
Esta mujer si que trabaja duro!!
For me ms. Liziqi is one of the best content creators, she doesn't disappoint her viewers and she put so much love and effort into her videos
The hard work that goes into all that HANDS DOWN GIRL!!!
It‚Äôs always good to share a good meals with good  friends.
i say it again and again, especially in this challenging time for the world hit by this corona virus,  this amazing beautiful young woman should be awarded the NOBEL PEACE PRIZE for bringing millions of people together ...who watch  her videos and see  how most of us have forgotten  how to live an authentic life.    Of course nothing stays the same.  There is continual progress, we need to feed, clothe and house millions... BUT we need to be mindful of all our actions, as SHE does  in the video,, and we need to live in harmony with nature, the animals and with each other.   The world will not change for the better until each one of us changes.   This one young woman is a remarkable example.  May all blessings continue to be bestowed on you, your family and grandma.
Dios bendiga las manos que alimentan las que siembran cosechan y dan vida salud trabajo calman el hambre y dan bienestar al mundo.  Gracias y bendiciones.

Lizi is such a beautiful young lady, and she is certainly an inspiration to all that watch her videos~USA
So hardworking lady 
She's a Precious Gem and an Angel
Bless her abundantly... 
Whenever I watch her videos I can't stop thinking about the modern and fast life that surrounds most of us.
The work on the farm is hard and heavy, but seeing the knowledge that she has managed to obtain makes me envy her connection with the elements of the earth, her landscape, her land.
It is clear to me that there is enough on this earth to feed everyone, but the crazy modern consumption rate seems  unstoppable.
when she dips her bare feet in the water or on the ground or her hands in the grains, I close my eyes and try to smell the life that can be projected onto the scene.
I would really love to try her cooking, because her food looks delicious.
In this world of chaos and pandemic, she is the only one at peace. Hats off to your skills!
el lugar me encanta. y la forma como hacen las cosas .
son muy valiente.  muy trabajador
I love your videos, I watch every night on tv.  You are amazing and wonderful and you work so hard.

She has helped me a lot throughout these times her videos are very heartwarming and pure i pray for you and your family 
I love your Videos. Their are so lovely made and I admire ur skills. Your always working so hard. Truly expiring.  I always watch ur channel when I need some calm me time. With great respect and love to you. ‚ô°
8:56 this single shot really surprised me... She went through the trouble of positioning her camera high up in the trees, all just for a shot that lasted 2-3 seconds?! This is so cinematographic, she is telling a story. True dedication!
Viewed-11/03/2022. She has done and shown an excellent work on the peanut and purple rice. An excellent example for the young. 100% thump's up!!!
Have to say that was absolutely amazing to watch!!! So hard working, what a woman. I have always loved the Asian culture, heritage, art, food,music and the most beautiful women that god ever created. Amazing 
Perfection in traditional.... No words for the simplicity but yet elegant
When she works this hard I don't have the heart to skip ads
Algu√©m a√≠ pelo amor de Deus, me diz que isso √© um filme e essa mulher √© uma atriz?  Mulher maravilhosa demais! Ela faz tudo, nem sei como vim parar aqui, mas n√£o vou sair Ô∏è

You are amazing lady hard working , you remind me when I was your age as farmer , I grew up as rice farmer and vegetable but you are more hard working young lady you do it all by your self , you are amazing Ô∏èÔ∏è
She must be the most beautiful human on this platform  pure and hardworking. Love her relationship with her grandma too 
Buenos d√≠as, me gusta mucho este programa, no s√© si ella hace todo ese trabajo ,y si as√≠ es es mucho lo que hace , pero sobre todo ,esas comidas y todo lo que hace de comer me parece que es delicioso,, l√°stima que no tenga traducci√≥n, alguno vegetales los conozco, pero toda la elaboraci√≥n no, como esa semilla negra ,y termina como en un postre riqu√≠simo.Pues felicidades a la protagonista que realiza tantas cosas a la vez, se que son programas viejos , pero algunos no los vi , gracias x subirlos de nuevo, su m√∫sica tambi√©n es muy agradable y relajante.Gracias y buen d√≠a.soy de M√©xico el pa√≠s.
Id like to commend her camera man for getting high and low shots. Even when liziqi is climbing a tree and such and taking shots of the plants growing with very beautiful frames. He knows how to take liziqi's beauty and amazingness in action.
Stir fry pumpkin vine + eggs yumm, it's my favorite dish. Everything made me drool, now I'm craving some
I use to hate living here in the countryside,  I felt stuck and I couldn't wait  to make enough money to finally move to a 'first World country' but finding your channel and watching your videos, seeing you living the country side life in the most simple and elegant makes me appreciate my life a little bit more. I decided to start documenting my life and it's has been so freeing to just be myself and share it with the world . I owe it all to you,  you have been my greatest inspiration .
Thank you Lizqi
mi sue√±o es tener un huerto m√°gico como el de ella donde crezcan todo tipo de frutas y verduras

My goodness Liziqi is a powerhouse!!!! 
This is the life that many people yearn for: natural, peaceful, together with their loved ones, aloof from worldly affairs, without lies, hypocrisy and  epidemic
how talented are you?am falling for your skill and hard workkeep moving
If she opens a restaurants I would eat there everyday and all her ingredients are 100% hand grown by her and natural
¬° Hola Liziqi ! I'm a Spanish woman living in the United States for now. Since I saw one of your videos, one of the first you recorded, I have been in love with the stories you share. As a child, I spent the Sommer months at my grandparents' house in the countryside and that time has been the best of my entire life. I admire the effort you put into showing us what a hard and creative life you lead.  Sometimes when you eat with your grandmother I get very emotional, then mine passed away a long time ago. I truly enjoy and admire what you do but I have a request: Would it be possible to have the translation of the Chinese words shown in the videos? I am really interested to understand everything, and learning Chinese is far from my skills. Thank you so much for making those artworks! ¬°Gracias! Ë∞¢Ë∞¢, Xi√®xi√®!
I have to stop watching as I‚Äôm getting so hungry for what she was making , cooking. Simple and I haven‚Äôt seen those kinds of food before! Excellent cook  all around!
Many Blessings to You and Beautiful Grandmother!
I love your videos because they are so calming
I love how comfortable she's always dressed
This woman is out of this world. No words to describe how incredible and talented she is. OhmyGod
I love how liziqi makes such a good person shes a gardener a chef a carpenter a designer and lots more im sure blessed be (anyone who reads this ) (edit) did I mention she is probably a very nice person too because I don't think I did

I Love It... food and all things it come from nature 
Beautiful work. This makes me happy, thank you.
The best rural cooking show ever!!! CAN NOT WAIT to see more. Most respected food bloggers ever too.
Her house is like a little village. Rooms look separated into little houses and the garden is all around. So amazing
You are the woman I wanna be growing up. Your so hardworking and smart and inspiring and so calm and I wish to be like you.
Liziqi is one of a kind Ô∏è
esta chica es una joya, una obra de arte viviente, simplemente maravillosa!
So peaceful... So soothing...
Now I've found a channel were I can fully relax and calm.
You are a beautiful soul. You teach me so much. You work so hard. I never knew certain foods could be made or stored in the way that you do. Only thing I could ask you would be that when you're using and gathering ingredients, could you put the English word of what it is? I see berries, and leaves and things in your gatherings I do not recognize and would love to know what it is so I can try to find it here in Tennessee USA and try to make it. And thank you so muchfor your peaceful videos. They really help my spirit.
My 1 year old son who can't pay longer attention to anything watches full length Liziqi videos 
Bravo, job well done. Excellent video. Great pleasure in watching, enjoying every bit of it!! Thanks.

Hii liziqi,i am from India ,i am seen your hard working videos  and realised that i 'm done 1% of your work in a whole day   you r such a hard working girl i don't understand sometime what you prepared in a lunch or dinner but food looks preety and tasty i really hope i just live in your area such a beautiful nature surrounding you ........you r mind-blowing....... lots of love

I have no words about her hard work .....May God Bless you and stay blessed forever.....
I wish i can be like her
She's very amazing
Everything is so gorgeous!
This must have taken a year to make this video - I don‚Äôt even know HOW I got here but by around 16 mins I was crying. I‚Äôm not sure why but the way she lives and works hard never complaining - never being lazy - never depending on ANYONE.... to me I think this is beautiful and we all should take lessons from this amazing woman. Years ago this is how everyone lived. Now we depend on machines and become lazy overweight and have our priorities way out of wack... people complain when their phone dies or they can‚Äôt play their Xbox. That isn‚Äôt what life is about and most of us have taken the wrong turn in life.... we had so much greatness- so many possibilities.... endless really....so much from the earth and we destroyed it. The world had so many rainforests and so much beauty we couldn‚Äôt see.... blinded by greed we have destroyed so much the earth has to offer.... perhaps someday we will learn what‚Äôs really important and start giving back to nature... it‚Äôs always been there for us but sadly we have forgotten what it‚Äôs REALLY there for.....not for us to build expencive homes or to make room for more big factories... the life we have isn‚Äôt going to last. It‚Äôs not what was intended for us as humans.... watching her and her way of life... this is how it was always suppost to be. It‚Äôs truely so so beautiful to me. X
She has a great talent 
I've never skipped ads on any of her videos. 30 seconds ads won't kill me.  This video alone took 9 months to make only for us enjoying it every night before we go to deep sleep.
I am addicted to watching your videos. It's just perfect.

How can someone live so peacefully with nature when people are behind internet with the fast paced culture. I really want to have a life lyk yours
I would be grateful if there could be English subtitles for the captions.

Iam very impressed about your doing things keep continue like this ...
Haters will hate and doubters will doubt. They don't understand what Li Ziqi is all about..........
Harmony with nature, together as one. Crops to harvest, work to be done.
Green green fields, mountain air. Home cooked meals, elder care. Peace and love, no despair.
...........A world of something special, something rare, something fruits of labor can only bear.

so sweet that her sister visited with her husband, they brought new cloth for grandma, grandma was so happy, and they helped Ziqi with cooking and cleaning. In Chinese culture, the Mid-autumn festival is about family reunion, may all the families in the world could be together and live a happy life!!!!!! drop a like and share the wishes!!
Really miss her, hopefully she‚Äôll make a new video soon
She is living an very peaceful life who agree

She's definitely not on youtube just to have a millions views and subscribers.
Her hardwork is what I admire the most, As well as her passion for what she is doing.
I pray that more blessings will come to her life as well as to you who's reading this comment

This is just one of the Videos on Youtube that has such beautiful content.
If someone asks what a beautiful woman looks like... show her this video!! I hope young women  would internalize this and learn the virtues of true beauty is work and service to family and others.
Es una chulada este video, nada m√°s antoja los platillos que realiza y ella tambi√©n
I just fell in love with this beautiful girl and her channel 
I love this girl she is very talented,industrious,she know how to bake a cakes,how to cook many kinds of food,she knows how to plants peanuts, pumpkins,cucumber and others there are many foods to eat ,fruits ,vegeatables etc...
Voc√™ √© muito inteligente voc√™ √© de verdade coloca a legenda.  
This girl teaches me we don't need all these technologies to live. I feel like she lives in a different world.
She is like the real life Cinderella 
This is incredible, not only the editing is top notch, her skills are our of this world; you can't fake this or edit this kind of talent into existence.
I admire the effort on the video.  It deserves an award.  If one asks what a beautiful woman looks like?  Show them this video.  I hope I women would internalize this as a meditation and reminder of what beauty is all about.
Beautiful girl,in a beautiful place doing beautiful things 
She should get a 3 star chef award
I want to be skilled like this! I love your channel.
Awesome content Ô∏è
Many people want to have a life like her, living in the countryside with abundant natural resources. But I don't believe that they can truly live like her. Just look at how hard she works... With life like that many people will start to complain in the first day...
As a chef myself this is nothing but an absoulte inspiration to me and awe striking......just wow
Ela existe de verdade??? 
The amount of work she has done in this video is greater than the work I might have done in one whole year! Feel guilty after watching such beautiful hard work.

IT's so lowkey to live in the province. I also want to live in the province coz it's therapeutic and less anxiety.

I genuinely believe that living a more wholesome life like this would help with mental illnesses like depression. We would be healthier, stay younger longer and generally live a happy more rewarding life. I cook, bake, and garden I can tell you I've never been happier.

I'm sorry to say I think I fell in love like having all in one lady congrats on you beautiful farm and blessings to you .
Ordinary life, a strong woman, the most important thing is her love and care for her grandmother.
There is no man on earth that deserves this woman, she is amazing! She doesn't need a man if she's not married. If she is, that man must be a saint or he must have in his past lives saved his country 10 times to get rewarded in this life with a woman like her.
She is wonderful person  love from India

Does anyone know what variety of peanuts they are? They are distinctly pale, with purple-brown markings, unlike any sort of peanut I have seen, or can find pictures of online. 
The seed pods look similar to some purple-skinned peanut seed pods, but the contents are clearly dissimilar. Its been driving me up the wall.

What a good house wife! Hard working woman.
The beauty of video...all the work done by her...
Greetings from Lapland, Finland!

Thank you, dear Ziqƒ´, for another soul-stirring journey into the natural harmony of country life. Your tales remind me of the words of another lover of nature & countryside, a Persian exile & prisoner from over a century ago, saying:

‚ÄúI have not gazed on verdure [greenery] for nine years. The country is the world of the soul, the city is the world of bodies.‚Äù  (Bah√°‚Äôu‚Äôll√°h, circa 1877)

Your beautiful, fairytale-like stories relate a similar message; they evoke a sense of spiritual meaningfulness. It is obvious that your youthful soul is home to such meaning & beauty.

My dear wife & I live in Lapland (Northern Finland). We are surrounded by a different, yet equally beautiful & pure & uplifting natural environment.

We also have young friends from China -- our former university students -- with whom we have a special connection, who keep in touch with us, and who have become like our own children. Sometimes we refer to them as our "xi«éo tiƒÅnsh«ê" (or "little angels").

Your virtuous and angel-like quality reminds us of them, our pure-hearted Chinese daughters. It fills our old hearts with hope to know that such angels still exist in the world. 

With love & affection from Lapland,
Partow & Anne
A multi-talented young lady farming in such pollution free environment ! She is virtually a fairy living in a lost horizon !!

The dislikes are probably from people whom she makes feel insecure about the lack of skills they possess compared to her . She is extremely talented and cooking is an art for her . What a special woman. She is an eptiome of what a traditional woman in Asia used to be ; beautiful , hardworking , fantastic chef, resourceful and just amazingly skilled

Liziqi... where are you? When will you upload your next video? Missed it so much
What can she not do : she can cook, build her own oven furniture, harvest grow her own vegetables and fruit, making clothes, preparing her own makeup products . Hands off to u girl.

We gotta give props to her team of cameraman and editors as well. I‚Äôm guessing she does many videos projects all at once and it‚Äôs up to the editors and cameraman to organize everything so it can be published later on.
One of the best show in history ever made

I dunno why people do not appreciate the photographer or videographer behind this video, I love Liziqi's work and appreciate it a lot Ô∏èÔ∏è but the way it has been captured by the person behind the camera is remarkable. I feel together they have made this channel successful. 
She's amazing 
I really like seeing her have fun and jump around excitedly, makes me see a side of her we rarely see. Love you liziqi

Although I enjoy these videos, they are relaxing and entertaining, I never forget that there are not the reality of the Chinese people.  They simply portray a fantasy that many would love to have.... In fact if all Chinese people lived this way then nobody would be watching the videos, they would not be special.

In love with the wonderful things that you are doing, my best wishes for you!
Thanking you for the beautiful nature based content. Just to say, in my newly released book, Re-imagining mathematics,  by Ashna Sen, I explore how the whole of mathematics can emerge from nature,  the arts and even community...exactly what you do!
I wish I could have a wife like her
So many skills at such young age. Wow amazing

She must be so healthy to eat this way. Everything fresh, seasonal......

The most beautiful rendition of the everyday beauty, bounty and gratitude for life. I have not witnessed a more poetically beautiful video on YouTube. Every move. Every well thought out step. Every grateful moment with Grandmother. Every stunning moment that pulls me into the beauty of the simplicity of every purposeful moment of life. So much appreciation for every thoughtful movement. Thank you Liziqi, for the stunning grace, peace and beauty you bring to the present moment. A celebration of all time. Of every generation. Of what is important in life. Your videos are deeply moving on so many levels.
I play again and again and again.... till i exhausted watching your videos... WOW YOURE PRETTY ... LOVE YOU LIZIQI

Lizi brought back to life the fact that we grew up being organic and naturally creative because of our circumstances. Yes being poor in riches can mean rich in what we have naturally. Liz makes being poor and living off the land God gave us more glamorous. I love the tools and the way nothing is wasted. I love watching her because it takes me back to how simple little things and plants can make big things with just a little creativity and patience. The lock down has shown us that too. Thank you Liziqi.
The cinematography on this channel is absolutely breath taking. I am amazed with the production quality. So much hard work, not just what is being shown clearly, but all the behind the scenes work. Amazing.

Wow! So awesome...in addition to growing and harvesting, you cooked all day for your dear grandmother and relatives. Everything you did in this video was an act of love. It isn't easy to make literally everything from farm to table...let along make it into a banquet fit for royalty. They are so lucky to have you!~
liziqi we miss you. you do not belong to our country, not from our religion but we love you so much. as a subscriber we all are your family member and we miss one of our members whose name is liziqi.
Imagine getting invited over to her house for dinner‚Äî
She is a super being in beautiful and bountiful surroundings which she is worthy of!
Best wishes to all viewers who are inspired with good will!

I'm always amazed by she's content, how long she takes to create content like this ... so cool!  Like we're really there and know all the process...great
She's living in a true paradise with all her efforts.Just came up recently to her first Video and here I am watching whenever I get time .Amazing nature and cinematography as well!
Kia ora from New Zealand  .Its great to see you in your gardens again  and to see your grandmother again too
She is very hard working girl and looking gorgeous
I love this video and great together with your family Ô∏è
Recipes please!!!
I rarely comment videos but it feels like I need to here.
I had and still have some hard time dealing with depression and anxiety for quite a long time now and I have to tell that your videos really help me to move foward, I'm not cured yet and I know it's going to take some time to do so but these videos really bring peace in me, it makes me feel like I can do it.
It might sound ridiculous but it inspires me to be a better version of myself and fully live my life.
So from the bottom of my heart : thank you for what you are doing, and I am sure I am not the only one you help. <3
Have been a long term fan of this channel. Thanking you for the beautiful nature based content. Just to say, in my newly released book, Re-imagining mathematics,  by Ashna Sen, I explore how the whole of mathematics can emerge from nature,  the arts and even community...exactly what you do! The pumpkin seeds have a beautiful mathematical arrangement...order and symmetry in nature.
Me encanta la naturaleza.....y el entorno.......
Great video, sis!
wathcing her live like this makes me want to go live in Guatemala and have a lifestyle like this. Guatemala where my husband owns land that is green. We live in USA we own land in the desert but i like more of the green land.
HOW MANY INTERNATIONAL FANS ARE HERE FOR LIZIQI ??
She is my inspiration to live a simple yet fulfilled life.

So many questions with no answers but I love watching! Great family time at the end too!
So I read an article about her, her parents divorced when she was very young, then she went to live with her grandparents in the rural area. When she grow up, she tried various job at the city.. once upon a time, she got a call that her grandma was sick so she left everything and cameback to hometown to take care of her nana. She was inspired by her brother who uploads singing videos on Meipai (Chinese social media) and thinking that she could do one of that too. Over the years through trials and errors she was able to build her channel.
After learning this about her, I was really impressed. All i can say is, she is truly a hard working person and never leaves her family. We all should be inspired !

Ps: All that woodworking and cooking skill she learned from her grandpa. Apart from this channel, I heard that she is also a bussineess woman
She's the best authentic Chinese cook I've seen so far. Good job young lady keep it up. No wonder you're famous in your country.
Nossa ela √© muito incentivadora, trabalhadora e mostra como n√≥s mulheres somos fortes e produtivas. Obrigada. Brasil.

I really like how to cook it. something new to me. There are so many ways of the art of Chinese cooking and I love it because the ingredients are fresh from the garden all around the house. Lots of fresh and abundant vegetables, beautiful nature in the mountains and various kinds of vegetables and fruits that I haven't seen before. I've always liked this channel.
I hope everything‚Äôs okay in your part of the world! This is such a nice distraction

I used to play harvest moon a lot when i was a kid and i always loved the calming vibes that villages gives. Maybe that‚Äôs why I love li zi qi‚Äôs videos so much. I‚Äôve always wanted to try living outside the city tho, surrounded with nature and good people
So very cool!  Love her videos!  Does anyone know where to look for those glasses and small pitcher that she uses at the end with the rice water?  If that liquid goes by another name, sorry.  I love those little glasses and pitcher.
She deserves the fortune that has come her way through incredible toiling.

I am curious though...do 4 people manage to eat the entire food that was cooked. 
I am very inspired and learned new  methods
Women  power and results of loving nature  
It is so beautiful and so naturals
The last 60 seconds is what peace looks like, for me. Liziqi makes my anxiety go away. Love 
I will say this Liziqi, when you have a relaxing no stress life you will last a very long time, while in the western world your under stress every day from getting up to going back to sleep, BUT not ME I retired early in my life to enjoy my life !
Love to give you a hand there, it must be so enjoyable, time consuming but no other worries in your life, no wonder your staying very pretty whenever I see you :)
I am obsessed with all her bowls and baskets 
Poetry, magic, love. Until the end of time and beyond every horizon
Just found! I had to go out and buy a new brain as mine was completely blown. Heaven on earth is the best way to describe this amazing oasis.  I am an addict now. At age 67 I hope I don't run out of time before watching all of these. Omg.

How do you know how to do all of this? I have so many questions.  Like are you the only woman besides Gramma at your house to share all these chores with?  
Don't you get tired?  I bet you are healthy and have had no surgeries or major illness if any at all? I want to know with this lifestyle does everyone stay healthy and live long?

You are so rich.  Of course you see so many comments like that but God bless you even more!  Don't forget to getarried and have a child so they can learn traditions and help you when you get old.
I've only have one word WOW!!!!! She is not lucky!!! she worked for everything she has and does!!!!
I salute to this girl and to her cameraman
Love these BEAUTIFUL an LOVING videos, I'm wondering what the fruit that was being harvested after the chestnuts were? Anyone know?
look. she multi talent and so beautiful Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è
She is teaching us women how to get back to our roles and work. I love watching her videos. Just discover her. 

Imagine her running her own restaurant and sell her own vegetables/fruits shop.
I am Indian and i love your all videos
I was born in a very closed place with ziqi‚Äôs home.  Everything looks so familiar. Their conversations, the food, the mountain, and the wind ... missing home

So here's the story of Liziqi. When she was just a child her parents get divorced, her stepmother was really bad with her and she find herself living with their grandparents. She learned a lot of with her grandfather, that's why she know to do all of that stuff, when her grandfather died, they didn't have money left (she was poor mostly of her life), she and her grandmother searched help with the government and the rural community helped them. She was a Dj (yes, I know it's hard to believe haha), also singer before these youtube thing. Her grandmother needs help now, and Liziqi made the decision that she will take care of her. She started a company to serve rural food to people from cities, and youtube/internet started here. She did her videos all by himself, she filmed and cooked at the same time, some of them takes year's to be finish, like the peach wine. She was born in 89, her actual name is not Liziqi, but it's quite unique the name she choose to be known. This woman is so badass,  and deserve all the recognition and how famous she become. She's beautiful and strong, a example of woman power and person.

ps: English is not my main language, I'm actually from Brazil. I know about her because of chinese youtubers that live here. Im sure you liked to know a little bit more about her, so that's it. Thank you.
The guy whom liziqi will marry will be the luckiest to have her as his wife. Beautiful,  soulful in and out ..

She must feel so fulfilled when she sees a the winter food store full of her hard hard work.

But something about this video charms me and makes me want to have a life in the countryside, away from my current life. 

I just want to be somewhere, my family and I could live in peace. Not have to worry about the issues of the city.

She's super perfect

You are Amazing
Liziqi is one of the people who inspired me to keep living even if i see no point
hardworking girl
A typical Chinese woman in rural area just like my mother.  So proud of them.
Liziqi is an amazing woman, with amazing skills and amazing nature ! Ur so blessed to have it all
So I read an article about her, her parents divorced when she was very young, then she went to live with her grandparents in the rural area. When she grow up, she tried various job at the city.. once upon a time, she got a call that her grandma was sick so she left everything and cameback to hometown to take care of her nana. She was inspired by her brother who uploads singing videos on Meipai (Chinese social media) and thinking that she could do one of that too. Over the years through trials and errors she was able to build her channel.
After learning this about her, I was really impressed. All i can say is, she is truly a hard working person and never leaves her family. We all should be inspired !

Ps: All that woodworking and cooking skill she learned from her grandpa. Apart from this channel, I heard that she is also a bussineess woman 
I am Father of Beauty in the World
I love you Liziqi, I can imagine how much hardship you have in life, However your smiles continues each time. @Liziqi
Amazing like a fairy tale :)) i can‚Äôt show my feeling now by any word! Love u Liziqi!
Why is this woman so strong?
It is so wonderful life.

This food is not only good looking, but I'm sure they're all delicious. It makes me realize how much work and care goes into making food.

Hebat ya, semua buah bisa dikonsumsi sama Liziqui, dikerjakan sendiri lagi. Apa sayur mayur n buah2 yg dia tanam nggak mubazir karena terlalu banyak, secara mereka makan hanya berdua saja.. itu jadi pertanyaan saya. Atau dia jual? Hahahhaha

Wow, what an inspiration this young woman is. I am in my 71st year and do not have the energy that she has, I also live where it is hot and humid but she inspires me with all that she does. Her life is lovely, full of joy in living each day.
Bro how do you guys have so many different kinds of crops on that farm? And how does it all get maintained?
Imagine if everyone starts living like her , 99 % of the contemporary problems will no longer be a problem.

My idea of paradise and happiness
As a rice farmer's daughter, I can confidently say: Nothing is better than freshly harvested rice. 

By the way, does anyone know what the variety of the rose shown at 2:18 ? After years of watching her vids, those roses still capture my attention~
Using your boot to get chestnuts out of the husk is the tried and true method.
a goddess amongst mortals
What are the small glasses she is using called?
What a great woman
Grate dream  life, natural life
She really inspired me to do farming. Now I started doing it step by step. She's very hardworking and beautiful. Worth to watch so inspirational woman!!
So much work that only young could do.
I'm crying at how perfect she is. So capable, so feminine. Why is she a real princess?
Her story telling is always amazing and there's no doubt about it but hats off to the composition, color grade and timelapses. Everything is so pleasing 
She shows a very difficult task in such a wonderful, easy and positive wayÔ∏è

Favorite so far! I absolutely love these videos & dream of a day when my family can live this way. My four year old loves to watch before bedtime. Thank you, Liziqi, for sharing your wonderful life with us. Ô∏è
I miss you where are you going please come back 
This channel is my therapy. I sit and have a cup of tea and just soak up her enthusiasm and hard work! I am always amazed at how many things can be made from one type of crop!
Such a hard worker. She and others like her inspire me every day. Love from Wyoming, USA. 
This video is all-together in another dimension of time than all other youtubers. Captures such seasons, fragrances, and life at length!
I am wondering how they are recording this
It‚Äôll be great if these videos had English translations so the viewer can follow long and be able to use some of these recipes.

Farming is very hard, back-breaking work. I know from experience. Kudos to anyone that can sustain themselves long-term like this. It is an inspiration for other farmers <3 Thank you for your peace.

I really like the videos from the liziqi channel in my opinion this is very interesting and entertaining, inspiring too, I always pray that Liziqi will continue to be healthy and happy
She is very hard working yet beautiful at heaven place
this what is really life should be, we are on best technology this time, but never forget we are part of nature, and this is the best example humans life should be. we can use technology to make life easier without sacrificing nature.
Wow!!! Wonderful creation
Are you from  Muslim territory?? At a point 1:12  of this video,  Maybe I heard something like Azan!!
I wonder if Disney would remake this into Mulan Part 2?
These people are real farmers, they grow every thing they eat, raise all their meat, I'm sure that there are men farmers there with Lizzi, it makes no sense other wise, Lizzi has no trouble with her chores, she has all the help she needs, she is beautiful~USA

Wholesome lifestyle. Her cooking method is beyond next level and she can throw.. I dunno what it's called... Chinese dart. Can we just all agree that she's the most wholesome woman on earth.
Linda!
I‚Äôm curious how everything tastes  it takes a lot of talent to be able to multi task like she can. When you first look at her your reminded of a flower very beautiful and delicate looking but then when you continue watching you really start to realize and admire how much strength she has.

Realmente es algo de admirar todo lo que hace, se podr√≠a decir que es digna hasta para convertirse en ejemplo para todas las mujeres sin dudas.

Such a amazing effort in making this video.  Very peaceful and calm.  As well as enjoying family and friends gathering.  Love the work and the serenity it brings. 
Her videos are so calming and peaceful it puts me to sleep im so glad i found your channel and your grandma is so adorable may god bless her with more life

I love watching the videos, and wish the recipes were available in English. I live in far Northeast USA where the weather is much colder, but I still have grown upland rice and many vegetables I see in the videos.
Anyone saw the strange thing she captured when she did the time lapse of the starts towards the end of the video

Thank you for inspiring us Liziqi, Love from the Philippines.
You amaze me Liziqi you touch my life in incredible ways, with your heart, skill, kindness and love and respect you have for your beautiful grandmother and nature. Bless you dear one for many more years and videos to come.
I wish to live in such a fascinating home at least for one day 
I really love the nature I wanna live how she lives 

Shes so talented. I just found her. Benge watching in the middle of the night. 

Watching Liziqi in the quarintine truly makes me miss my childhood days when I would wait for the summer vacations to arrive. So I can go back to the village my parents come from. Can't help but remember the days as a child in the village, roaming around the mountains and sweating buckets under the hot sun. Playing cricket with just one bat and a stray bamboo stick with my cousins and the neighbourhood kids. Just messing around in the house when the adults are gone, running to the bed when a loud thunder is heard during the rainstorms. There a bridge under which a rail track goes and more often than not, we would just walk along the tracks on a cool evening. Munch on wild raspberries without a care about our stomachs. Playing with almost torn Uno cards while sitting high up on tree branches cause the younger children wouldn't stop ruining our game. Dying from heat and just making a hell ton of newspaper fans cause the electricity was cut off for like a week. Playing a test of courage at night but everyone's so scared we end up all going together instead. Would try to balance on thin log bridges and visit river beds, lose our sandals in the mud and nearly topple away trying to climb the slope (mostly me, who lives in a city. The rest of them rarely fall off).


Now all of us are nearly grown ups. No one is willing to endulge in these "childish activities" anymore. My village now developed a lot, there are less fruit trees to climb on now. The small paths to climb down to the rail tracks are gone as well. 


Sometimes I remember the anguish and pain of tiredness in my body I never experienced while being back in the city, as my cousins force me to climb up a hill with them for the 7th time.


But I have also never have felt more alive  in those memories as well.
O material apresentado √© t√£o rico e maravilhoso, que nos faz chorar e rir ao mesmo tempo. Que lindo lugar, que mulher incr√≠vel √© essa. Parab√©ns por tudo e obrigado pelos videos.

 I just don't get it.
I wish I could get links to all music in her videos.. They bring me so much peace and joy. I adore her videos and style so much
I like watching her of everything she does and I admired their cultures because they don't even have no time for tv I love to watch this so relaxing want to learn of how to cook their food 
Wow so cute rose
I'm just thrilled, the colors, ideas, traditions, all the work, richness with all veggies and fruits, flowers...the half things they eat I didn't know we can eat!!!  And everything is just so beautiful ... greetings from Croatia...
Who shoot all the things amezing yar 
She is one of the most beautiful  girl that I have ever seen in you tube. Her each recipes are unique. I am all over from Nepal. Most of the plant  veg fruits landscape are similar as Nepal. I have learned a lot from her. Thanks to all the crew members exploring such a brave, strong, kind hearted girl and the real beautiful rural life.
I wish there was a house tour and a tour of the property and a tour of the garden. List of food and vegetables she grows and what she perseveres. . Most of these videos are her day to day life which I love but I‚Äôll to see the whole picture if that make sense. Anyways much love from Canada üá®üá¶ 
This girl is so hard working and so beautiful! I like all she does and how she does it! Thanks a lot for the video!

Es tan trabajadora que siento gusto al verla, se ha ganado mi admiraci√≥n, la labor del campo es la tarea m√°s noble y humilde que existe sobre la faz de la tierra. Sin nuestros campesinos no ser√≠amos nada.
Very very nice video
To think she isn‚Äôt even 30 yet and she does the work of like 5 or 6 people all by herself. Whenever I need motivation to put some real work in, I watch her videos and realize it would take a lifetime to do what she does in one video. I don‚Äôt understand where she gets the strength to do such back breaking work. Wonder who taught her how to do all this. Does she ever just sit still and do nothing. I really love how she has so many animals around her - dogs, cats, and other farm animals. She seems to appreciate every side of nature. Hope she stays healthy with her grandma for a very long time. ^^
I love everything about it, especially accompanied by very peaceful music. wanna live her life

this girl lives the life of a fairy tale, and lives in an area with pretty much every single resource of food, and tools at her finger tips. i would be so amazingly happy to live a life like this
Is it possible to get a translation on the foods and other descriptions?

Wow! Beauty with brains. Organic stuff. Very peaceful setting. 
You are so lucky to live with Grandma!
Good luck and good girl ad she's grandma also good
Hi Liziqi, do you live like that or just make videos for your channel? I am very curious to learn more about your lifestyle. Because I love to grow agricultural products.

So I read an article about her, her parents divorced when she was very young, then she went to live with her grandparents in the rural area. When she grow up, she tried various job at the city.. once upon a time, she got a call that her grandma was sick so she left everything and cameback to hometown to take care of her nana. She was inspired by her brother who uploads singing videos on Meipai (Chinese social media) and thinking that she could do one of that too. Over the years through trials and errors she was able to build her channel.
After learning this about her, I was really impressed. All i can say is, she is truly a hard working person and never leaves her family. We all should be inspired!!
El hacedor de vida... Recoje su siembra... La naturaleza siempre lo recompensar√° por su esfuerzo es volver a La fuente de la vida... Estos videos son maravillosos y reconfortan el alma...
In China, some of us were jealous of her and brought troubles and discomfort to the uper. I was shocked that her video abroad was so popular. I am so happy.

I‚Äôm still amazed that she can get such thin and perfect slices with that sharpened slab of metal. 
It just goes to show you don‚Äôt need a fancy, sleek, and state of the art culinary knife to cook.

She is like a live telecast of someone from heaven for me . Truly mesmerising, humble,caring beauty both in and out . True portrait of How merciful God is towards human until they know how to use the nature !! Love every bit of this

you are very skillful
I dont understand how 17k people dont like this. This woman is amazing. The production is amazing. She does alot of special things and she has alot of special skills that the modern world would need. God forbid, if there was a food shortage or something along those lines were it would be hard for you to access food or crafty knowledge, you would probably want to be around this woman and her skills to survive another day. I learned a little from watching her videos. Great job and God Bless you Liziqi, i love what your doing.
Me I love it a lot
This is exactly the kind of life God intended us to live.
Is very Amazing Life,  Silence and Peace fully.

So much hardwork n labour... salute to this young lady..
I really Love This Place

I can bet that foods that made by her are 10000 times better than Chinese restaurant's food 
Her work, decoration,skin everything is

This is what true wealth look likes. Not million dollar houses or fancy cars. A wealth of knowledge and self sustainability.
I really want to go there 
How can they say Liziqi only has Chinese fans? I am African American in the US and I love her work. I especially love how she treats her elders, and really everyone.
Miss you 
Anybody who grew up in southeast Asia on a farm, I want to ask, is this really how life is? I would love to live like this and would be more then willing to move, but I don't know if this is completely make believe or if some of it is true or if it's all real....
Very Nice your Farming
Oh, to be the dinner guest of Liziqi...
This woman is magical.
watching her videos is very relaxing.

She's beautiful,talented and hard working  love her

Looks like a she is living in a peaceful heaven with beauty all around and healthy foods
You are a very hard working person.Ô∏è
As most people compliments everything of this beautiful intelligent lady.  As an Asian lady myself, (clearing throat)....I can imagine how difficult it would be for her to find a real man in her life.  She is the badass of a mix of both man and women.  She can do it all.  With or without a man‚Äôs help.  She is strong.  Most men find it hard to handle a strong women.  I grew up in a little town, my family lived in the countryside, we farmed, and raised our own livestock‚Äôs.  I was let go because I was told, I was too strong for him to handle.  But, I see everyone complementing how awesome this lady is.  It brings me smiles because I feel good for her and myself.  I know, this organic lifestyle is not easy.  But, it‚Äôs the rewards that it has to offer in the end.  Each time her videos shows up on my feed, yays!  Click!  
This is a heaven on earth I love it
Everything is sooo eyesoothing Ô∏è

not surprising, how they respect and look after their elderly unlike the selfish millennials in the west today
Whoever reads this:
Stay safe and sound for u and your family. We will overcome this together! We are one humanity one love one blood. Don't let this tear us apart. We have the internet to spread love and positive thoughts. And we have the ones we love to give us the strength to carry on. That's all we need make this world great again let's just all do our best to get this over with and never forget what we will loose if we give up on hope.
Much love to all of u and hopefully we can continue this wonderful life in the next year like we used to know it. Never give up! NEVER! 
Seems like alot of fruits and vegetables grow so big there. Watching her work makes me feel lazy. 
Who is this wonderful smart kind woman that takes such good care of her family? I would love to live there with them it looks so wonderful.
I'm just wow 
wow, this is natural but insane 
So nice

Im starting to think she is really Demeter the goddess of agriculture
She is so beautiful and Hardworking 
I wonder how you can have learned so much about farming and about making a living with so many facilities ,tools and well equipped house available  !  
Have you been brought up by knowledgeable and tasteful farming parents ?

No words to express...
Sangat cantik
It's an Asian culture when you visit a home there's really an urge that you also want to help. I also do that most of the time. It's just so embarrassing when you just sit around while the host is really busy preparing for some food.
Grandma  is just the cutest!!
Amazing series of videos
I realy love that girl
Liziqi is the most accomplished woman on earth. And on top of being able to build and create almost anything useful in this world, and cultivate and cook any food, she is also beautiful. How is that even fair?

I just came across this channel, and all the videos are so beautiful and calming!  It's so impressive how Liziqi works really hard in the farm and on her crafts, and then also makes the time to prepare such nice videos!
Good life
she will not lack of any food even being lockdown for 5 years in this pandemic
I'm deadly allergic to 99% of the food she makes but everything looks so good and her videos are so calming
My gosh. What a hard working girl. I can't even exercise early in the morning, and she already did lots of things even before the sun rises. All fresh vegetables and fruits! So healthy.

I absolutely love her channel. So relaxing and inspiring.

Whoever her husband is one of the luckiest person in the world
I admire what you do and how you live. I was told being a farmer was for the poor and stupid. I guess they are wrong. I enjoy watching this channel. And I aspire to be a farmer gardener. Ô∏è

I‚Äôve been in love with her since the first time I saw one of her videos. Never happened to me before, I feel so confused... & happy. What an amazing, definitely exhausting  person. & cute grandma ... I live in China, by the sea, i‚Äôm a sailing captain, I was visiting a school & before I spoke they were playing a video of this girl... I had to wait until my presentation was over, then I asked ‚ÄúWho is the girl in this video? I think she is my soulmate.‚Äù  ... then I found she is very famous & probably every man in China believes she is his soulmate. but, I still feel lucky to feel this way about another person, although it is illogical & ... embarrassing. So, this is my story, why I am here & how I found this video. :) Goodnight everyone. Sweet dreams.

Dear Li Ziqi,
You are one blessed human to get the opportunity to leave within the full resources from mother nature. Fresh air, fresh food sources. You are living far a away from polluted air, nor population. Your living area surrounded with wonders awaits to be discover sooner or later. There is no worries of starvation nor blood shed of wars. TBH, I am jelous with your lifestyle and wish I can leave besides you to experience every single second of your future journey. Sending you love, respects, and happines from üá≤üáæ

Wow
Pure art. Bravo! Compliments and warm wishes from Macedonia
Love you,,,,,
I, too, would like to be a guest in her house and be treated so warmly 
Whoever marries her is a lucky man. Beautiful and intelligent, and a master home maker and chef. We need more traditional women like her in the USA.

other people tried but her videos stand out because of her editing and artistic eye.
Liziki, you're making the people believe that humans should play the role of the protector of mother nature, not her destroyer. You are a soulful leader to keep the earth green, blooming and blessing with plentiful harvest. You appear to live like a fairy and make us visualise how beautiful a pastoral life may be.....
How can life be so perfect...

I want to try her food!!! Looks delicious!!!

So I read an article about her, her parents divorced when she was very young, then she went to live with her grandparents in the rural area. When she grow up, she tried various job at the city.. once upon a time, she got a call that her grandma was sick so she left everything and cameback to hometown to take care of her nana. She was inspired by her brother who uploads singing videos on Meipai (Chinese social media) and thinking that she could do one of that too. Over the years through trials and errors she was able to build her channel.
After learning this about her, I was really impressed. All i can say is, she is truly a hard working person and never leaves her family. We all should be inspired !

Ps: All that woodworking and cooking skill she learned from her grandpa. Apart from this channel, I heard that she is also a bussineess woman 
I am Father of Beauty in the World

This definitely motivates me to put my smartphone and computer away.

Liziqi, I am ashamed to ask more of you because you do so much for our worldview already. But you should, really, think of cloning yourself, and teaching your incredible skills throughout our very rich world impoverished by greed. Life's too short. Please do not go before you have recreated yourself for S. E Asia, Africa, and S. America, too!

Keep beautiful, angel of our world!!
You are amazing and awesome cheef.
Lizi

I miss you
If you are new here, here is absolutely everything you need to know about Liziqi ( Li Ziyi ): 
 
In 1990, Li Ziyi fell to the ground in Mianyang, Sichuan. Her parents divorced when she was very young. Later, her father died, and Li Ziyi became an orphan. His stepmother didn‚Äôt treat her well. Li Zizhen mentioned on Weibo that he had had a half-dead experience when his stepmother dragged her hair into the gutter and was beaten.
 
Grandpa and Grandma distressed granddaughter, and finally decided to take Li Ziyu home and live. When Li Ziyi was in fifth grade, his grandfather died again, and it was difficult for his grandma to raise her to continue school. At the age of 14, Li Ziyi had to drop out of school and go to the city alone to work hard, and began an 8-year wandering life. Her first life was very hard. She slept in a park chair and scratched her head for two months.
 
Li Ziyi has also worked as a waiter in a hotel, with a monthly salary of 300 yuan. In order to earn more income, she went to learn to play discs and sang in the bar. Later, when talking about the matter, Li Zizhen frankly said: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say that I liked music at that time, just to live, I felt that it was well paid.‚Äù
 
In 2012, because grandma was ill once, Li Ziyi was worried that she would regret it later, throwing away all work and returning to grandma. ‚ÄúBeing closer, I feel more at ease.‚Äù
 
After returning, Li Ziyi opened a Taobao shop, but the business has been up and running, and he barely eats. In 2015, under the influence of his younger brother, Li Ziyi was exposed to the short video platform Meipai. Until 2016, seeing that his younger brother had some fans on Meipai, and holding more fans can improve the mentality of Taobao business, Li Ziyi re-entered Meipai to prepare for his own video program.
 
The reason why she chose to shoot videos in this style is closely related to her childhood environment.
 
In an interview with the living room of Sina Club, Li Ziyi mentioned, ‚ÄúAll these things that are self-sufficient in the countryside, for me, they are jealous. In the short video, she chose to start from the most familiar places.
 
In the beginning, Li Ziyi gave himself a topic called ‚ÄúFour Seasons Change, Eat While You Eat‚Äù. After the suggestion of Meipai editor, it became ‚ÄúAncient Food‚Äù and it is still used today.
 
In September 2016, a new opportunity came quietly, which also became an important promoter for Li Ziyu to get more attention in the future. Sina Weibo began to openly search for more outstanding short video creators for resource support.
 
As mentioned at the beginning of the article, Liu Tongming brought her Weibo resources support.
 
One day in September 2016, Li Feng, an ancient short video blogger, accidentally received a private Weibo message from ‚ÄúMr. L‚Äù. Mr. L expressed his love for Li Ziyu‚Äôs video content, felt that he had fulfilled his Taoyuan dream, and hoped to meet her.
 
For a long time after that, Li Ziyi received Mr. L‚Äôs private letter. ‚ÄúIt would be a shame for such a good video to let this person see it. This is usChina‚Äôs proud traditional culture should be seen by people in China and around the world. ‚ÄúMr. L said in a private message.
 
At first, after seeing these private messages, Li Ziyi didn‚Äôt care too much, even worrying about encountering a liar. Until one day, Mr. L came to the city where Li Zizhen was, and wanted to ask her to have a meal and talk. Mr. L‚Äôs politeness and clear logical thinking made Li slowly drop his initial alert.
 
This accidental meeting has completely changed the life trajectory of Li Zizhen. Not long after the meal was over, with the help of Mr. L, Li Zizheng was supported by a large wave of resources on Sina Weibo, accelerating her popularity and allowing Li Zizhen to rush into the queue of the net influencer on the head.
 
This experience is partly recorded in a diary of Li Zizheng that year. Some insiders close to the senior executives of Weinian Technology confirmed to Tencent‚Äôs ‚ÄúShenwang‚Äù that the ‚ÄúMr. L‚Äù is actually Liu Tongming, and his pseudonym was publicly reported. Daxiong Liu, the founder of Wei Nian Technology, an MCN company to which Li Zizhen now belongs.
 
On December 8th, the reading volume of a Weibo topic labeled ‚ÄúIs Li Ziyi a cultural output‚Äù climbed to 800 million. Li Zizheng was once again on the hot search list.
 
The video created by Li Ziyi and her has become a phenomenon worthy of study now.
 
Extensive overseas communication is an important reason for Li Zihuan‚Äôs renewed attention. Some people say that she has filmed a desirable rural life and spread the charm of traditional Chinese culture and cuisine. Others think that her video is not completely true To reflect China‚Äôs rural life.
 
Even the queries that have been popular since the explosion have been brought up again, such as being a DJ, being a rich second generation, whether the video is from my own hands, is there a strong push behind it, and the video is true for rural life It‚Äôs still just a fiction for character setting.
 
An insider of Weinian Technology told Tencent‚Äôs ‚ÄúDeep Web‚Äù that Li Ziyi was of ordinary origin, and the relevant video content was produced by Li Ziyi himself. The popularity was not the initiative of the company and himself. In fact, both Li Zihuan and the micro-reading team behind him were quite low-key, and they were very enthusiastic and declined all the current interview needs.
 
Until August 17, 2018, Li Ziyi‚Äôs eponymous Tmall store officially opened. Six days after going online, the store with only five products at that time had sales of over 150,000 and sales of over 10 million. A year later, the total sales of 21 products displayed in the Li Zizhen flagship store exceeded 1.3 million, with total sales reaching 71 million.
The value behind Li Ziyi‚Äôs IP is being quickly tapped.
 
Li Ziyi started from scratch and gained the first fans with his own strength. But now the popularity and gains of fame and fortune are obviously no longer just her achievements.
According to Tianyan search, ‚ÄúDeep Web‚Äù shows that MCN Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co., Ltd., which Li Ziyi belongs to, was established on February 28, 2013, with a registered capital of RMB 5.208 million. According to the introduction, Wei Nian is an entertainment entertainment company that incubates KOL into IP through short videos and extends to consumer brands.
 
The information of Qixinbao shows that there are more than 100 pieces of intellectual property information of the trademark ‚ÄúLi Zihuan‚Äù. The applicant companies are Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co., Ltd. The product categories include food, clothing, shoes and hats, dyes and fats, beer and beverages, Financial property management, catering and accommodation.
 
Not only that, Wei Nian also has inextricable links with Li Ziyu‚Äôs companies.
 
According to the eye inspection, Li Jiajia (should be the original name of Li Ziyu) established Sichuan Ziyu Culture Communication Co., Ltd. on July 20, 2017, and Wei Nian is its shareholder, holding 51% of the shares. Supervisor, Li Jiajia holds 49% of the shares.
 
According to other data, there are as many as 50 beneficiary companies behind Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co., Ltd., including Greenland Holdings, ZTE, Xinhua Media, Vanke, Light Media, etc. .
Among the shareholders of Weinian Technology, Sina Weibo is particularly eye-catching.
 
From Wei Nian Technology to Sina Weibo, Li Ziyi gradually has the best cards that internet celebrities are looking forward to.
In her own words, she changed from ‚Äúa little transparent to a person who is so useless to society‚Äù. After entering the public view and being noticed by more people, Li Ziyi‚Äôs sense of responsibility has also become heavier.
‚ÄúI want to do what I can to do more things that are good for society, such as the spread of traditional culture, non-heritage cultural craftsmen, and I want to show these old things to everyone so that more people know. Li Ziyi said.

They eat the food even the luxury hotel didn't serve...Amazing..
The soil in her farm must be very fertile for everything to grow so nicely. Does she put fertilisers in her farm? And is she a Hakka? Because the Hakka clan is well known as good farmers traditionally.

After watching the liziqi channel for months now, this is becoming one of my favorites! The life of series with cucumber and tomato specifically being the videos I seem to watch most. Two of my favorite vegetables and I love learning the planting to meal preparing.
WHAT ARE THE FRUITS AT 9:10  PAW PAW ?
Not surprised she won the plant throwing game too!
One of the best videos I've seen in a long time!  So beautiful and peaceful to watch.  Amazing work!
I just saw this yt channel and I was amazed of how skilled she is. I love watching it for it is so relaxing. I think this will be a good video to watch whenever you are stressed or tired. I really recommend this one. Love it

please don't be fooled by the video....she's an awesome actor and addition for her people BUT   this is a well organised video with high quality team being her, she's the face of what the government want you to see ....don't forget she's a multi millionaire woman with multiple companies bringing in earnings...its not her grandmother or whatever but great actors to give u all the tranquil settings of what rural china could be from before and as ur all well aware its not like this anymore.   but congrats to the whole team behind her and to the quality to her videos   amazing stuff and mesmerising

10/10/2020 USA Grandpa Bill:  She is like one of those beautiful paintings that have come to life.
This is the first time seeing this channel, when i saw the thumbnail i was thinking it would be a new drama series with a kind of ninja thema. But watching it slowly and found out it is modern easy real live reporting. And what a beautiful host, you really can see she enjoys here live. I would ditch my current live for this one, when i had the change.  

I loved the drama series "chef Hue" and now i found someone that is as talented IRL.  I hope to see more of here in the near future.

This was what my late mother wanted during the last two weeks with us on earth: sticky rice with pumpkin leaf soup.  

Liziqi reminds me so much of my mom.  My mom was very hands on and creative with wood, farming, and cooking, and her love for her elders.

She reminds me of when I was a child. I always helped my grandpa harvest peanuts in a field just a few minutes from my home. And now for almost fifteen years that field was abandoned, just a few banana trees have grown wildly.
I wanna live there, the scenery are so nice

I'm so humbled and inspired watching this channel. She is just a remarkable young woman, and the grandmother is visibly so proud of her.

God bless her, for taking care of her grandmother, and making it possible that she spends her golden years in peace and comfort.

She and her videos have become a part of my periodic happiness. God bless her .
Six month efforts to make all happy i love that hard working team and the girl leader
why would anyone dislike these videos... I'm so confused. I live in the city and I'm so intrigued by her life. and the ending where she threw the darts and got them in! The shot with the wind in her hair- so mysterious!

Whoever the videographer is, is amazing as well. What incredible shots.
She does not falter. She does not complain. Shes so pationate and great at what she does. I wish I could learn how to do all these things, but theres so many other things I also want to learn. Its sad that our time in this world is so short. So stop wasting it, stop being lazy, enjoy life, learn as many skills as you can and make it a life worth living.
Like a haven Scene....I hope I can be there..even though I died 
Actually it's very late u didnt upload any videos
For all the people here saying that her life is so peaceful and they wished to live like that. Let me tell you that you don't want to live like that.

Waking up at 6 everyday, work, work, work and then prepare things in the evening when everything goes well. If not youre working till night. You just have to make things happen. You can't drink coffee, can't eat your favorite meals, can't take a proper warm shower, can't lie down and relax watching netflix and most importantly you can't take days off, weekends don't exist.

I wish we all get to live like this at least Once in our lives. Then we'd understand how hard it is for those people to bring all those raw ingredients for us. And we will never waste anything anymore, we would understand; Life isn't always easy to go, that it's not in the bustling and busy life we have everyday but how we connect with nature, understand her and be more careful with what we do. We need to understand that alot must be given than there is to take. Love the VideoÔ∏è. Stay safe everyone
So beautifully shot and edited!
So much Appreciation for every part of the meals, created with care using almost all the ingredients collected gathered and braught. 
This makes me happy to see there is still this respect for the meals, preparation, growth and harvest. Thank you 

I am proud to have witnessed such joy, care and family bond.

One of my Favourite YouTube Channels #1 shared with a similar channel both show such respect towards family, harvest, cooking and meals. 

Have a wonderful day.
Esta mujer es estraordinaria me encanta ,estos v√≠deos no tienen que faltar y que tierra m√°s buena
Is there anything she doesn‚Äôt know? Amazing  

I liked your video so much. It made me feel relaxed and calm. 

Great job!! 
I like her video so much
I've never had authentic Chinese treats. It's a shame most of the Chinese style restaurants here in the States mainly focus on entrees, which are predominantly considered "junk food" by authentic Chinese standards. I think what intrigues me the most about the treats you make is that I seldom see you add unnecessary amounts of sugar. Keeping them naturally sweet with the fruits, rice and grains pulled from the Earth.

The sheer amount of physical labor she does is staggering!  She is strong!  Her plants always look so healthy and lush.  I like watching the baby plants start to grow.
When ever I get sad  l watch her videos because these motivate me to make life beautiful and happy
Oh my gosh that looks soooo good!!!

Actually really more. Not only is beautiful,  and with such a variety of flavors and parfums...

But also you feel the dedication and love on each one of the dishes.

Ah, I love Liziqi's videos so much. Milady, I send you much love from France. You show the perfect life in my humble opinion. Flamboyant nature, animals, skills, calmness, beauty, self help, and no pollution, no cars, no ugly smokey city. You're blessed, Milady. And you bless us with a glimpse on your wonderful life. I wish I was like you, free, living in nature, and able to do all these things. You will obviously survive if a zombie apocalypse happens.
Edit: in France we are very proud of our food, but I need to say: Chinese (and Asian) food is TRUE ART. Colorful, healthy, yummy, I absolutely love to watch you make food.

What a luxurious life not everyone can afford.

I always wonder everytime I watch her videos, I always wonder on how does she maintain her clothes clean, well not that clean clean but just clean... I mean, all those works then in the end it's still clean.
I look like it's Arabic
The ending makes me so happy and Liziqi looked like a princess in the wild. And then the others cheered for her !

I'm just amazed at how she knows all of this. It takes time to aquire this much knowledge and even more time to put it into practice so effortlessly. I will start my own small garden this coming year but I'm already overwhelmed by everything I need to know xD!

Wonderful video. No wonder she has more than 14 millions subscribers. +1.

she is living his best life, i think its better than watching korean drama lmao

Who could possibly dislike ANY of her videos? This content is so beautiful and well done. I watch these every time I feel stressed and need a peaceful, beautiful distraction. Thank you for all that you do with your amazing talents! It is so refreshing to watch and I am in utter awe of you.
I'd rather eat the foods she prepared than those gourmet foods prepared by chefs.  Home cooked meals are still unbeatable
I haven't got to smell the scent of ripen paddy for last 4-5 years. I stay in city to pursue my studies but currently I'm in my home village due to pandemic. I had an amazing opportunity to plant rice in my grandparents home. When I visit them on saturdays, the feeling of watching paddy grow that I planted, feels so surreal. They'll be ripe in few months but I doubt if I'll be able to feel the scent as the university might be calling us soon to conduct our exams. But I sincerely wish God to give me this bless as well. Yes humans are greedy
Peace and HARMONY is pretty much ALL you need for Happiness.
She is amazing & very beautiful

I know some people want more in life, but I would like this. Farming and listening to music and reading books while I take lunch and before I fall asleep. Maybe I'll crush some leaves and charcoal and berries and flowers and make paint to create artwork for my walls. I can raise chickens and maybe a cat or dog that keeps the pests out of the storage room. I could tell the temperature by watching and listening to the birds and crickets and can get ready for storms and bring in the laundry by smelling the air and identifying the clouds. I can watch the tadpoles grow into frogs in the spring and see the deer and squirrels and birds raise their young when the last frost turns to dew for the season. I can dry my own tea leaves and sit outside when it's still chilly in the morning and sip my tea and eat the eggs I boiled last night with some toast with butter and the preserves that I made last summer.
I would love that.
Smart camera person and talented  liziqi..
I'm new to her channel and I have been binged watching. She's is so talented.

People are in awe when watching indeed a skillful girl doing a lot of things...but how many realize that God - the Creator of everything - the Father , the Son and the Holy Spirit are worthy of praise for providing us with joy, rest, food, nature,  strength..etc ?!?  :) Glory be to God , the Lord above. May the God of Israel, bless everyone and keep you safe. May He open your spiritual eyes to receive His Salvation and everlasting life. In Jesus's name I bless you.

Do anybody know what she does against slugs and other vermin which damages vegetables in the fields? This vegetables look always without prejudice when comming out of the patch.
So amazed every time. The skills and abilities she has are beyond incredible
Her silky hair always makes her look good  even if she wakes up!

This is the Chinese life I remember, my grand mother took me out to harvest herbs, taught me how to make dumplings (bao Jiaozi), grew mushroom on our own, always a couple of jar of Fermented vegetable at home, western media Villainize China on the daily basic, nobody know most Chinese people are simple artsy and peaceful creatures, we need more recognition for people like liziqi, because simply, she reminded me the childhood life I had with my grand mother.
liziqi inspires everyone who like to work and love health, thank you for so many ideas from your village...long live for your grandma.

She is so determined and focused that anyone can see in her eyes.... Specially in last of the video while aiming....A Perfectionist
I love how she bravely walks around the fields unlike me scared that I'll get bitten by a spider.
She's definitely a real  masters chef
If that food is on my table for dinner, i would cry instantly and then appreciate her for the food....such a heavenly  btw i love my mom she is great cook......hmmm! Yumm! she worked so hard by herself all day. And man, she is innocently beautiful if that‚Äôs a thing. Dont know why i said that but she is truely gorgeous. Lot of them show skin but she is an absolute fine woman ... .....her husband is very lucky man.
Como ela consegue cuidar de tudo isso sozinha,nossaaa!!!
TEN KOSZYK NA PLECACH!
Your work is Praise worthy....u sow , u reap then cook..take months of hardwork...& Background music adds grace to ur vdos

This is an example of a real role model.A woman who works hard with grace, perseverance and passion. A rare woman who values simpler things in life rather than flaunt her private parts just to get famous. Salute to you Li. You should be emulated. If I have a daughter, I will teach her to work hard and become like you
Wonderful your videos and the way you cook such beautiful dishes from your gastronomy. I would love to learn from you both in agriculture and how to cook your beautiful dishes. And now you are very beautiful and dear. Hug fromPortugal

She grows so much food, I wonder if she sells some of it, because it seems like it would go to waste otherwise. But she has shure made herself a garden of eden there, and she is certainly 5 star chef quality rated for her creativity in the dishes she makes, they look amazing! I don't know if she does, but she should definitely have children to pass on that wonderful creativity and spirit of hers, as I think she would be a wonderful mother. Maybe adopt some if she doesn't want to get married.
Thank you liziqi

Kimchi is a traditional food of Korea.
It's not a traditional food of China.
Not only for KOREAN, Everyone who ever heard about Kimchi will definitely think Kimchi is the traditional food of Korea!
4 years ago, when there was a conflict between countries over the THAAD deployment, the Chinese boycotted pork belly and kimchi in retaliation against South Korea. But now kimchi is from China? Hahaha

Does anyone else dislike the fast forward parts? Old videos were so much better... Had so much more mystery and shared an idea of calm and peaceful...
Recent videos became so... Accelerated... Rushed... It took part of the magic that had around her and brought something more... Realistic.

Miss li looks busy bored n tired lately... harvesting rice, cooking special meals, n making vids altogether must have consumed her energy too much many jealous people also continue to give her hard pressures

Call me and get married. I love you!
I really love watching Liziqi's channel cuz i remember my childhood,we use to harvest peanuts in our neighbor and they pay us.
Tell me one thing this girl can't do......?
Whoever dislikes this video is leading a hollow, wretched life.
I just feel so calm every time I watch her videos. And her creativity in her cooking inspires me so much.
Liziqi... You are the best!! Love your shows, such skills and dedication is an inspiration to all
Wishing you the best for the new year.

I dont understand to those who dislike this video , there is no vandalisme, pornograph and others bad things ...
Why...?? 
Can you do better or the same like her ?
If there is some mistake in this video ,such as video technical, compersation ,shoot angle, or else, ...it just only common mistake that everybody could do the same or worst....nobody is perfect,isn't it?
Hi Liziqi! I love your Youtube videos! I have watched every single one. Every time you upload a new video, I watch it right away. I know you like to keep your personal life private, and it adds to the mystery of you and your channel. But I hope that one day we can see a video of you talking to us, even if it's just a little bit!

Wow such a hard worker and very talented, lovely to see working so connected to nature and wonderful food.
Who else been watching " Liziqi " for more than a year? 

Watching her channel for the first time. And this is the third video. I thought okay I will watch one and will add to watch later. Never thought that I'll get addicted to this.
Love from india, Kerala Ô∏è
Imagine how much effort, time, and energy she exert in making these videos.
Boa tarde amo seus v√≠deos
Liziqi helps me find peace during the pandemic and the video even helps me study! I use it as my study background music.
Like how does one even learn all of the information it took to make this meal!?!
I‚Äôm guessing that the reason she is now using so many accelerated scenes is because there were sooo many people in China question her by saying she didn‚Äôt do all of the work by herself and she was just acting out few scenes and recorded to show us. And some other people also said she was too pretty to be a hard worker. That‚Äôs totally bull shits and never ever judge a woman by looking at her appearance!!! Be respectful plz!!!
She is gorgeous talented girl amazing food amazing cooking style love it
For some beautiful reasons, Liziqi's videos are very soothing and comforting. Ô∏è

It is really impressive, watching you do this things. Cooking for you and your grandmother. Building these things, only with historic and easy tools and using what the nature is spending to you. This way of live is very impressive. You will do anything for your grandmother, building shoes and a sleeping pad, and some more.
I hope, you can do that for a long time. Helping Your grandmother makes her happy again. She must love you so much for doing all these things for her.
You're so inspiring

You're so talented! Show your Chinese pride! Don't steal Korean kimchi!
Just like someone said ,nothing worth having comes easily.
Chinese claim that because the main ingredients of cabbage, radish and so on are the same, kimchi in Korea and Pao cai in China are the same.  But you need to check this below.

For example, such as Dim sum and dumplings (called MANDU in Korea), Pizza and Pancakes, each has its own recipes and stories, and the time and efforts of the ancestors who have inherited them and so they each are different. 

It is history and culture to inherit in everyday life of the nation for a long time. Chinese you guys don't know the subtle difference, so you keep screaming ‚ÄúKimchi is ours‚Äù. However, it is clear that Chinese Pao Cai and Korean kimchi have a different name, seasoning, and recipe itself.

It can prove more clearly by checking Korean Kimchi adopted as world standard from Codex (International Food Standards Committee) and ISO number is also different.   

Please Stop insisting anymore. 

You guys should know that Koreans like Chinese cuisine like Jajangmyeon, so we inherited it with a Korean own recipe in S. Korea for a long time. But the cuisine is sold at Chinese restaurant with calling a  Chinese cuisine.     

In other words, Koreans respect and protect food originating in China as their own food. Even if we transform it into our own recipe and have eaten it for a long time‚Ä¶

We have each respectable culture as each nation.

A common sense that any civilized country under the rule of law understands: how can a country‚Äôs army be raised by the people to serve an illegal, non-popular organization? When the ruling class takes control of the knife and serves itself, then the ruled class is nothing more than a bunch of poor leeks or poor fish on the chopping board. What is also terrifying is that Leek actually has the ruling class thoughts to protect the ruling class.‰∏ñÁïå‰∏ä‰ªª‰Ωï‰∏ÄÂÄãÊñáÊòéÊ≥ïÊ≤ªÂúãÂÆ∂ÈÉΩÊòéÁôΩÁöÑ‰∏ÄÂÄãÂ∏∏Ë≠òÔºö‰∏ÄÂÄãÂúãÂÆ∂ÁöÑËªçÈöäÊòØÁôæÂßìÈ§äÁöÑÔºåÊÄéËÉΩÊúçÂãô‰∫éÊüêÂÄãÈùûÊ≥ïÈùûÊ∞ëÈÅ∏ÁöÑÁµÑÁπîÂë¢„ÄÇÁï∂Áµ±Ê≤ªÈöéÁ¥öÊéåÊéß‰∫ÜÂàÄÊääÂ≠êÊúçÂãô‰∫éËá™Â∑±ÔºåÈÇ£È∫ºË¢´Áµ±Ê≤ªÈöéÁ¥ö‰∏çÈÅéÊòØ‰∏ÄÁæ§ÂèØÊÜêÈü≠ËèúÊàñËÄÖÊ°àÊùø‰∏äÁöÑÂèØÊÜêÈ≠öËÇâ„ÄÇÂêåÊ®£ÂèØÊÄïÁöÑÊòØÈü≠ËèúÂ±ÖÁÑ∂Êúâ‰∫ÜÁµ±Ê≤ªÈöéÁ¥öÁöÑÊÄùÊÉ≥ÈÄ≤ËÄåÁ∂≠Ë≠∑Áµ±Ê≤ªÈöéÁ¥ö„ÄÇ

Oh my goodness, the super cute oven at 12:42!! At first I thought it's a Totoro oven, but probably it's not. It's probably a Chinese figure/character which I don't know. Maybe a panda or bear? But I really wish I had an oven like that! And I wish I had a garden where I could put the oven. These videos are like relaxing therapy. Despite that she workes so very hard. I feel very relaxed and happy while watching, wishing I could do the same work, and that I was just as skilled, talented and knowledgeable as this amazing girl.

Most rural Chinese over 40 years old have experienced liziqi's life. For example, I am a few years older than Li, and I also experienced her work when I was a child, so watching the video is just recalling my childhood life.
I love plants your plants are nice
Love you 
I'm very love this channel because I like liziqi when she was cooking
You are great person
She does all the work? even carrying heavy stuff... 
As the saying goes " I Put Blood, Sweat, & Tears into this", She's put it all into her channel, her career, her way of living, & surviving!! I admire her strength.... Her videos are my daily motivation!!! She's put it all into building her own brand, as a reminder to never take life for granted being that she came from the bottom & a broken home, but it didn't break her she turned Pain into POWER! Liziqi- A true Inspiration, Role Model, & Influencer Ô∏è

In fact, I spent a long time in the countryside when I was a child. I didn't have a mobile phone or a computer. My only electronic product was a bulky color TV. I spent most of my time in the grass, or spread a blanket under the grapevine in the yard and looked at the sky. However, I still prefer city life. Although the air in the countryside is good

She has discipline and order. That‚Äôs makes her special otherwise who lived in the communist country they know this is normal .

Either way this has education point which is what people may need right now. Not naked , drugs, guns and cruelty and to deal with insignificant people.

Hi admin. can I get Black Rice seed and rapeseed seed from you? I live in Bangladesh. I will pay the cost of Rice seed, parcel, and other costs. So it will be beneficial for me if your could send me these seeds. Thanks.

As a Chinese , I would tell you that even Chinese people can't understand what they are saying because they are speaking the Chinese Sichuan dialect with a heavy accent. So just enjoy the images and the story. ^ ^
And one more, you are Japanese or Chinese or Korean?????

Why do I get so emotional?

within 18 hours, there are 1.6 thousand dislike? why? Is it because of competition between YouTubers? or just people who are jealous of a perfect life like liziqi? ahh i don't understand at all

Like this one here 16:02 i thought that it's just a decorative plant, cuz I've never seen anyone use this for cooking

She certainly did receive many nasty evil wicked and jealous comments in the past. Those people do not even know how to make their hands dirty or how to survive as they sit behind their computers with fake nails and wearing heavy make up and expensive clothes. Probably they do not even know how to cook either or way too lazy as they can afford restaurant foods to live on.... Her grandparent passed to her all their wealthy knowledge after she did returned from the suffering city life and evil family member. Change her life around she is willing to learn from her Grandparent, wealthy knowledge passed down to her what city folks has no idea about. Just mention some: how and when to sow, how to grow, how to cook and preserve food  in season. What to use from the nature in season for dishes. How to keep animals. Look @ her artistic creative dishes, chefs craving for the knowledge and for the quality ingredients to use in their dishes. She become an extremely skilled woman. I adore her because she has a strong spirit a very kind heart. Not many people do look after their elders as she does look after and care about her Grandma Ô∏è
I want to thump like 10 times for her! Her hard work is worth. I feel amazing many times while watching the video

People always say she is multi-talented and wonder if it‚Äôs real, put anyone in her shoes if he/she can survive then he/she will be the same ‚Äúmulti-talented‚Äù. My grandma did farming all by herself, she knows hundreds of editable herbs and mushrooms, feeding livestocks, using millstone to make tofu. Plus she‚Äôs one of the three tailors in that village so she also worked full time making clothes to earn extra money to feed her four kids. She‚Äôs much more ‚Äútalented‚Äù than Liziqi at the same age bcos she married early and had kids and was the only labor in that family. She married to a soldier who could only back home once a year. He served the country and she served the family. Pls don‚Äôt judge the authenticity of Liziqi‚Äôs videos, she‚Äôs a true female farmer. She just does makeup and uses skin care things like every girls to make her looks better in the camera.
Wow!!!

She may not be posting all the time but that what makes the viewer miss her. And all the waiting is all worth while because she makes great and informative videos. I'm truly a fan.

How can she do this so hard
I know this is partially contrived, and no one person could keep up with this scale of farming, animal husbandry, cooking, etc (even with the help of her girlfriend/assistant) but her videos are magical & she has many imitators (the highest form of flattery) she is genius. God bless her, she deserves a fortune.
Why do these puppies never seem to grow? Does she breed dogs?

Li ziqi is always the influencer i love most. she has gone through so many adversities with positive and persistent  spirits. She did not complaint of the unfairness of life but to be self-reliance, self-improvement, and  keep learning. There are lots of people in the modern society having so much resources but they are still unhappy. They take the all for granted, and crave for more. Li ziqi is eventually rewarded generously for her kindness and diligence. jia you! ziqi!
I want to marry her she is gorgeous

As much as I love watching her shows which obviously takes months to make, I adore her perseverance and sheer hard work.  I wish upon that falling star to live a life like hers. 

Alas! I can't because I'd need to own a large fertile patch of cultivable land and a fertile forest nearby that is not exploited, not to mention the amount of cash required to do what she's doing. That's my reality check

This is the most beautiful way to live Ô∏è But day by day many people's are forgetting this epic way to live. Many people's are dependent on big cities & High Technology's.

The way you make purple rice in Indonesia is called tape ketan. Purple rice is ketan hitam. And the fermentation water is Badek. It is so warm and have a strong taste.
After this pandemic is over I have to have a nice family gathering.  This time has made me really appreciate how important human connection is.
After doing all this ,she looks pretty..how!!!...
I'm a farmer too ...I know how hard it is to be a farmer,...
She is a real inspiration for me.
You know you are amazing!!
I wonder how did you learn all that..you know alot of things
You works so hard. .and you still super pretty
Every time you post all the stress of the world dissipates, into calm serenity.
Her connection to the Natural World is amazing just like in A CANTERBURY TALE com.

I Think This is the Perfect Life to Live as per the Rule.
The key to 12 million YouTube subscribers:

An idyllic rural location
A cornucopia of fresh produce 
Well crafted and edited 4K cinematography
An iconic soundtrack
And a beautiful woman who works her fingers to the bone whilst looking elegant in the process

Easy!
Walau di Indonesia sudah tengah malam tapi dapat notif langsung nonton dong
It's so peaceful and calmly even though I live in a city
Watching her for 2 years. First time I thought she is filming cause the quality she made, but by her own. Later lots of people involved more like  movie now. . Team work works. I am inspired and learn a lot apply to  my video. Great
Idea . Except the advertisement is so annoying.
She knows almost everything about farming, house chores, and more

This is what true wealth look likes. Not million dollar houses or fancy cars. A wealth of knowledge and self sustainability.
Why did it have to end . Now I'm going to be restless again until she uploads 
I think Liziqi is as close to perfection as anyone can ever be. She is more beautiful with each video.

These  videos should be a world wide heritage for generations to come, maybe a better understanding and respect   for  nature and its benefits overcomes the harshness of  modern mechanism and technologies.
Camera must be every where...editor did quite a great job
So I read an article about her, her parents divorced when she was very young, then she went to live with her grandparents in the rural area. When she grow up, she tried various job at the city.. once upon a time, she got a call that her grandma was sick so she left everything and cameback to hometown to take care of her nana. She was inspired by her brother who uploads singing videos on Meipai (Chinese social media) and thinking that she could do one of that too. Over the years through trials and errors she was able to build her channel.
After learning this about her, I was really impressed. All i can say is, she is truly a hard working person and never leaves her family. We all should be inspired !

Ps: All that woodworking and cooking skill she learned from her grandpa. Apart from this channel, I heard that she is also a bussineess woman 
I am Father of Beauty in the World
Son- mom I'm hungry.
Mom- wait 5 year's 
I love village's culture. I want to live with you and I want keep my kitten's with me.
That is why i love this kind of video bcoz i can relax and forget my problem temporary atleast this made my day thank you Ô∏è
Her grandma is so ADORABLE 
your grandma is beautiful, i love her laughs!
I would even like to go to the cinema and buy a ticket to watch her films.
She is so Hardworking

She's full of energy all throughout the day. Hats off to her hardwork and multi tasking.
Everytime I see her vlogs I feel like Eden Garden is still on earth to this day and Liziqi lives in it.
When she cooks and creates these beautiful dishes, it's like watching her create masterpieces.
Her videos are my shoulder to lean on whenever I have my depression. It calms me and appreciate the life more and more!
Can we take a moment and just appreciate her. She is so hardworking 
i won¬¥t say anything new, but this videos are absolutely stunning . Love from Argentina!
I pray she and her grandma remain healthy and safe from this crazy ass world ‚ô°‚ô°
Que alegria por lo que veo estais bien, se me hacia larga la espera, y hoy mismo en el anterior video, preguntaba si estabas bien, me alegro, gracias por mandarnos esos videos, tan interesantes,

Hello from indonesiaüáÆüá©
This video makes it seem so easy but in reality it is so difficult. Good luck with channel ;)
Can't believe how much winter veg u were able to care and grow.   That's a lot of works, got to give props to that.  Jealous of her stoves,  I rember when my family had a wooden stove of much smaller size to cook
Li Ziqi is literally the most complete and authentic personification of ‚Äúvery and greatly hardworking‚Äù that I know of, to date! Absolutely beyond amazing!  
It means she takes months of months to make video
But what she does is very common hereÔ∏èn m proud
Whe saw this video. I remember my old days means my village life style. So liked this video so.... much. This is a natural life style. She is very beautiful and intelligence lady in cooking.

in Indonesia, there is a dish called "Tape/Tapai Ketan Hitam", it's basically made from purple glutinous rice, which is fermented only with yeast. when it's done,  the taste is sweet and sour, and we can drink the water of it. it contains alcohol but not too strong, it depends on how long you want to ferment it.
I want that starry night sky as my screens wallpaper, how gorgeous it is!

the only thing I wait for in Youtube every month
I still remember when I was young in Sichuan China, girls who were most diligent were most admired. Ziqi is one of those girls. I love people from Sichuan:)
The piano music is so soothing that I saw the whole video twice, this time with my eyes closed.
So I read an article about her, her parents divorced when she was very young, then she went to live with her grandparents in the rural area. When she grow up, she tried various job at the city.. once upon a time, she got a call that her grandma was sick so she left everything and cameback to hometown to take care of her nana. She was inspired by her brother who uploads singing videos on Meipai (Chinese social media) and thinking that she could do one of that too. Over the years through trials and errors she was able to build her channel.
After learning this about her, I was really impressed. All i can say is, she is truly a hard working person and never leaves her family. We all should be inspired !

Ps: All that woodworking and cooking skill she learned from her grandpa. Apart from this channel, I heard that she is also a bussineess woman.

You can completely forget a one legged man... Ms. Lizqui is "Busier than a three legged man in a butt kicking contest!"  

I don't know exactly what all the foods are, but I will say this, "She sure does put a whole lot of love, energy, time, effort and joy to make them as beautiful as she can!!!"

Thank You Ms. Lizqui for another great video!!!

Time for relaxation! Amazing video as always, my beloved Liziqi!  You are the daughter of the mother's nature! Ô∏è
I absolutely love the idea of using huge hammers for cooking  also, who else enjoys the harvest part even more than the cooking part?
I liked how some of the videos have subtitles (closed captions) on what she is saying, what the foods are called, what she's doing, etc. I don't speak Mandarin or Traditional Chinese but it sure is helpful to have them!
Thank you so much for the sharing you life with us. This inspires me a lot to share our little island life as well. To make food, eat while watching sunset is the best part of the day ever.
Enamorada de su cultura, me encanta su gastronom√≠a...
Dios mediante espero poder viajar y conocer mas de su gastronomia 
I live in country side and had to struggled many things. Sometimes I feel tried to the point where I can't bear but watching her video make me to realise that it's not the time to give up yet.
Thank you so much Liziqi
Hola Liziqi, de nuevo ayer por la noche estuvimos (con mi esposa) deleit√°ndonos de tu nuevo v√≠deo. Que trabajo m√°s productivo hiciste en esos meses, sin duda la cosecha la pudiste aprovechar. Gracias por compartirla. Exelente trabajo! Abrazos a ti y a tu querida abuela.
Please send my love to your grandmother <3 she reminds me of my grandmother when I looked after her at a very young age. Thank you for your hardwork and I love how your videos have inspired me in so many ways <3 love from Fiji
Always a blessing to watch one of your videos! Not a huge fan of the fast forward parts but it shows you all the hard work we know she does every day 
I loved her videos! She is amazing, does everything and she never looks tired! The videos holds so much attention that we don't even see the time goes by!
Everything is so artistic and down to finest details! Even the self made oven and drinking cups are so adorable! The videos are so precious due to deferred gratification. We are not only witness the presentation of various delicacies but also the process of making them from literally scratch!
Everytime I watch Li zi qi's videos. They all makes me comfortable with peaceful sceneries and food.
i love her content its so soothing and calming
I love to see how the cat-oven evolves over time from very new to 'stood-here-forever'. 
And did you notice the tons of garlic and chili? :D

Hi,I am from the Caribbean,your stamina is fantastic, I must say, and it would be a wondrous experience to learn to prepare food  the way you do,with the equipment you use,especially the steamer craft thingy that you use probably with some slow burning plant material as fuel ,well done,you really gave of yourself

A family gathering like this ,where everyone eating , laughing , enjoying the time is so satisfying
I really want to get garden tour in her home. I am so curious how many plants at there.
I am shocked that how she can do a lot of work and never feels tired . I am a great fan of her and her work also

Oh my goodness, isn't this the first time we see some of her family that isn't her grandma? Brother, sister, brother-in-law, sister-in-law? Not sure since she calls them both Sister and Brother but ohhh I'm so happy!!
I think Liziqi and I need to talk about her farming practices, as well as postharvest management. So, I'm study botany honours and one of my course is postharvest physiology. I'm very interested in how she is able to maintain quality with the limited technology she has. I may be able to help, if she wants someone to talk to about improving things. However, she seems to be doing just fine

So . . .my pride at using my new rice-cooker from WalMart, and getting it mostly right, just seems a little sad.  
I have to admit, I followed about , maybe half of what was going on, I think this episode introduced more types of food and preparation than I have any familiarity with.  I love watching these videos.  I always say I'm just going to watch for a couple minutes, but who am I kidding?   I am astonished at the back breaking labor she is capable of, and clearly she is someone who throws her whole self into an endeavor.  I doubt half measures would be tolerable, and I mean that as a compliment.  A true master of her craft, and certainly Renaissance Woman is a far more apt description than a Jack- or Jill of all Trades.
Who all feel it's a energy boasting or stress relief video, the wonders she create, stay blessed.
She would put to shame any Michelin starred chef with her ridiculously amazing meals. In fact, the work that went into just creating that meal would've killed most people!
OMG the food looks so good. Never had real chinese food before.
Your food is killing me imagine I was sitting there on table,OMG
She's living in a beautiful world like my imagination ,but it's real
It always makes me wonder, how many more things could she have done if she wasn't filming and editing these videos?

There's always so many comments on this channel about how wonderful life like this is, how much better than our own, how humans have strayed so very far from how we were meant to be and live. And I'd like to respond to that sentiment.

The only thing we humans are "meant" to be, at our most pared-down, is socially dependent. We get depressed because we don't take care of each other as we should (though having plants around and something to tend to can certainly help!). They (rural Chinese) get depressed because they're poor and being exploited by their government, and are just as if not more vulnerable to other health issues due to their lack of access to a robust health system. Liziqi is an exception, with the privilege of her fame and wealth making all of these things in her videos easier to accomplish, plus a talented film crew there to make it look as idyllic as possible. I'm not saying this is fake, because it isn't, but it is designed to be an escape and perhaps, for us, a peek into another culture and how other people live. It's entertainment, no matter how genuine. But the people there don't choose to live entirely self-sufficient like that, and romanticizing their hardship is both unkind and shows just how out of touch we are, and how much we take for granted. Not to mention it is utterly unproductive for the improvement of either side of this conversation.
 
If you want to live a better, happier, more peaceful life, there's nothing stopping you, and it doesn't necessarily take moving out into the countryside and starting a farm (which would not be at all peaceful, lbr). Take care of yourself instead of just "treating" yourself, learn more kindness, give more than you take, focus more on what you have than on what you don't, own up to your shortcomings and work to improve them, but also learn to accept both yourself and your life just as it is. Forgive yourself when you stumble or fall short of your own expectations. Be patient with those around you. Pay attention and try to really understand them as they are, not just as you prefer them to be for your own convenience. 

Get some plants, make new friends, take chances, love like you'll never be rejected even when it hurts, and live, live, live.

Hi liziqiI really love how you turn everything appetizing and deliciousüáµüá≠üáπüáº
Omg! First video i saw of this channel! I have to say im getting in love with this perfect rural life! Gosh! I'm shoked! This is the retirement dream of any man who wants to spend his last years by eating respecting and learning from our friend's "mother nature" Ë∞¢Ë∞¢!
Hi Liziqi.. I've been watching your video since 2017. And this is my very  first comment on you. "your video is full of joy and life". 1000years later youngster will look over this videos again. So charming.. Congratulations, you got improved a lot on video quality. And last.. You're beautiful as always. Send my best regard to your grandma.
Hi, Liziqi. The Bible describes a women like you in Proverbs: 31, & that she is worth more than a bucket of rubies. Your not kidding me. My wife is like that in her own way, which she learned from her mom. My wife is the 1st in her family & family tree to graduate High school, & college & even a Masters. Her & her parents where born in Asia. God really bless me & I know Liziqi is so bless also. I just love your hair, it's so thick & pretty.
this girl must be one of the richest people in rural china
It's lucky to see first. Wish every one good time to see this clip.

I love your culture, I regularly watch your videos, I dream of one day coming to your beautiful country, in this countryside. Thank you for making me dream. Yours, and big kisses from France.
I love this girl... She is so pure and natural  she does things what she likes and never copy others  she should upload more often.. It feels her last vdos was uploaded a thousand yrs ago  I know her vdos and works r precious and laborious and it takes a lot time but still my heart wants to see her new vdo everyday if possible which is not  okk lot of love to u liziqi from Bangladesh 
Can we also appreciate the camera team for capturing everything with perfection..
every time i wonder how she manages to carry all that and work tirelessly,my back  would ache if i even tried 1% of what she does
The quality of filming is now professional and beautiful, as is nature! One of the most beautiful parts of China! Thanks for your efforts to take us on a journey, @UCoC47do520os_4DBMEFGg4A and crew!
Your garden is so beautiful and you definitely have the green thumb!! Keep up the good work!! Love from USA...
I love watching your channel! It's very calming. Much love from Phoenix, AZ
It was so cute seeing her have fun at the end. I'm glad she made some friends to wind down with. Hopefully they're not grubbing for her money

Beautiful, inspirational, but how many of us would work our butts off to live like this.  I grew up on a small farm and we were pretty much self sufficient.  However, my mother worked hard preparing the garden, planting, harvesting, shelling peas, canning during the hot days of July and August.  We milked cows, took care of the calves, took care of the pastures.  It is hard work, folks.

This women inspired me to keep working hard hard no matter if is just u and your maternal family just keep working and living life. Because life is not easy it has challenges  and been a women is not easy is a lot. I hope men who watch this video value hard working women and women who love there family and the role they have in society.  Not all women work , cook and clean. But the ones that do they work hard and some people don‚Äôt value that until they are gone. Women like this should be valued and respected. Thank you liziqi for been such an inspiration for women

Why is that we dont see any insects on the plants or the trees in your garden...I thought there would be more bugs...how do u keep them away???

After that, I clicked her profile, and i can't believe myself I watched another her videos..
