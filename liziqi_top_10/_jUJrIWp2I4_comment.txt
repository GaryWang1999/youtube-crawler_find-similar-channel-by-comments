J√° experimentei alguns pratos da culin√°ria oriental, principalmente China e Jap√£o e digo,: H√° uma sensibilidade natural no modo de fazer e provar! Gosto muito!!
Parab√©ns a est√° bela garota!
this is my first time watching her video, i love how they made this kinda content seriously, with great editing. This is the content we need. Imagine if local content like this were made from all over the world, how beautiful it gonna be.
I love your videos! They are so peaceful and the epitome of what I want someday for my life. I always come back to this one and the year of the pig Chinese New Year! They are two of my favorites (though the newest New Years video was amazing!). Much love from Florida, USA

I discovered her at 2am and I literally think there is no better channel. Her videos are soothing and educating and Honest content.
In a time where everything is fast and noisy, it's good to get these relaxed vibes and natural sounds, like drops of water, birds :)

Hola desde Espa√±a: con impaciencia esperaba un nuevo video eres una artista cocinando y haciendo todo me veo reflejada en ti yo tambi√©n hago los arreglos de la casa del campo y de los animales vivimos en el campo y cuidamos nuestros animales que nos dan de comer. Sigue haciendo videos me gustan much√≠simo un abrazo muy fuerte
Eu amo como vc √© abilidoza. Isso √© um dom especial. Sou Brasileira aqui de Pernambuco Barreiros. Queria cozinha como vc. Uhuuuuuu que cheiro bom. Kkkk
My mom would cook authentic phillipino food every single day without stop, after she lost her battle with cancer about a year ago ive never had the same feeling of just coming home from school to smell the most amazing food ive ever tasted. Your videos brings back these memories, the frying of the food sounds the same in your videos, her tossing the food in the wok, the scrapeing of the metal on the pan, i can even SMELL whats going on through the screen. Your videos saved me from ever forgetting her, your videos helped me out through those dark times, though its not phillipino food, the way you cook is so so so similar to my mom‚Äôs. Thank you for that. (Ive also shown these videos to my dad and he also loves them, my entire family is full of cooks so this was a breath of fresh air)
As we can see in the videos, the background of the forest, farms, yards, cooking stoves and utensils are real. In the past especially for the Chinese people  our ancestors work hard on every inch of lands they have. They make use of everything that nature provides to them. Generation by generations the land grew flourish. This final generation from baby boomers era (like the grandma) likely the last of their kind, because due to the changes of modern and tech/gadjets world. Not many still living up the life just like showed in the video because the generation X,Y and Z are working and living in cities to find income and mostly leaving the old man/woman at their village. In the end leaving the lands and farms unattended (because grandpa/grandma are already old to work and care the lands).
Most end up selling their land and the money the new generation get were invested in businesses, building or renovating house in the cities or in another country, etc. 
As you saw in the video, you can see herbs, clean ponds and rivers, varieties of vegetations, animals like birds, chicken, duck,  are well taken care of. These are their daily source of food because there are no supermarket nearby where you can buy from there. Thus, why need to buy if you can get it fresh from your own farm? Chinese are particular in what they eat (diets and healthy) so they grew herbs, vegetables and live stocks. That is how the baby boomers generation survived along the years away from town or cities. 
The beautiful lady is one of the most impressive grandchild in her family. Not just beautiful but also hardworking, diligent, caring and humble because she still carry on her family's tradition and the lands. She learns all sorts of cooking, fermenting, recipes could be mostly from her grandparents which is oustanding. 
I too once lived like hers until i was 19 years old and i loves everything just like hers until my grandma passed away and the land was sold by my uncle that year. 
The memories I had never perish. I still remember the smell in the morning when I'm standing in the middle of the farm, the morning dewdrops on the leaves and grasses, the sounds of birds and water flowing in the small river, the bamboo forests in the evening like golden, chasing gooses, collecting the chicken eggs, collecting the sap from rubber trees, the soothing cold wind on the pepper farm hills, catching grasshoppers among the grasses, catching fireflies at night, the smell of firewood burning while boiling hot water, the food that my grandma used to cooked, my cousin shouting from afar teasing me while plucking potatoes from the ground, etc. I misses all that when I watched the video. 
I did went back to the village a few years ago but it wasnt the same anymore and the place changed alot and the farm wasnt like it used to be like. The peaceful life that I missed.
It looks very satisfying that everything is available in the garden or to say farm.The way of cooking ,doing things are so nice...And also gave me lots of tips
I want to live with her for 2 years and learn the art of her cooking. Perhaps just live there forever
This is another incredibly good, brilliant, beautiful, and INSPIRING video from Ms. Liziqi (who is also beautiful, hardworking, and brilliant.).  We over here in Los Angeles, love your videos so much.  The videos are also very therapeutic, soothing, and relaxing.  Thank you so much for sharing all your videos, and for all your hard work. 
So much love goes into her food. Watching her and mom relaxing makes me feel good. I want to visit.
I love the way when she finish cooking her grandmother comes out to enjoy the meal. Her grandmother is a star!
Que lugar lindoÔ∏èüáßüá∑
Grandma is so lucky! She is eating good food made with lots of love!
Watching her videos have become my stress reliever from the crowded and busy city. It‚Äôs so peaceful and makes me love nature even more! Ô∏è
this is my first time watching her video, i love how they made this kinda content seriously, with great editing. This is the content we need. Imagine if local content like this were made from all over the world, how beautiful it gonna be.
Thank you liziqi. 
Whenever I've had a tiresome workday... I lied down getting to watch ur videos which soothes me and my mind n gives me a pleasing rest well. 
Maravilloso esta forma de vivir y comer , seria genial traducir todo , y saber los ingredientes
Its so nice to watch this kind of videos, because this pandemic limits us to travel places, but because of your video i have the luxury to see your place in my own home and this makes me learn something from your beautiful culture!
And most specially thank you for inspiring me to create countryside life content, love from the Philippine countryside Ô∏èüáµüá≠
My mom loves to cook bamboo shoot too. And we cook it along with tempeh and coconut milk (we called it santan) and belinjo leaf (idk the english name) and i really love it, ive tried cook bamboo shoot with beef but the bamboo shoot turn out a lil bit bitter LOL
Give this lady a Netflix Show already.
Liziqi and Dianxi are seriously living my true life dream of living off the land in the countryside making food for the family everyday with wild natural ingredients or plants/livestock I planted and raised from the start. I wish there were areas that are as abundant with farm land and wild edibles as their countryside but I live Southern California where the only thing in the wilderness is dead grass and mountain lions lol  there are a lot of squirrels rabbits and skunks for a source of meat but I wouldn‚Äôt be able to grow or pick any of the amazing types of fruits and vegetables they have in their videos
LuosifenÔºÅ! As a Chinese living abroad, sometimes I want to eat a bowl of Luosifen. I love the Liziqi video.She advertised China to the world on video. Thank her. Look forward to her other videos.
You're so hardworking and beautiful, I love the simplicity. Also you're a great cook, I would really like to learn some of your recipes 
Luosifen is life it‚Äôs so good. I keep buying the instant luosifen packs ever since I first tried it. I wish I can actually go to a authentic Chinese luosifen restaurant and try the fresh made ones
Liziqi is a soothing content creator who wants to share traditional Chinese culture. She does most of the work herself in her videos with some help from friends, relatives and neighbors, but she does the final editing of the videos.
1 million views in only 7 hours. I feel so proud of her and I am so happy to see her account grow so much here outside of China.
Excelentes comidas excelente paisaje y excelente mujer felicidades 
I just amazed by how she use all the leaves vines ect as packing of food or rope while me struggling going to barware store or supermarket to buy so many plastic products......   Liziqi really inspired me so much during this pendemic and we decided to find a house with big land to sort of creat a dimension like her home. It's touching me everytime when she show me the skills and wisdom of how to deal with nature. Also I feel sorry that my grandparents are no longer able to pass on me their knowledge of how to use bamboo and traditional local dishes......  all of the short stay in rural area are shining memories to me.
Amo esses v√≠deos! Beijos brasileiros!!
Congratulations! Your videos remember me of my lovely childhood in the countryside and my grandma's awesome cooking!! Furthermore, your videos have an eerie aesthetic. They seem etxtracts from a film! May I ask which camera do you use? By the way, which editing programme do you use?
Tudo parece muito gostoso.
I always love your videos! Soothing to the spirit. I wish you had the recipes in English. I want to make them so bad! Maybe you can create a cookbook and publish it in various languages. Living near Seattle, Washington in the United States, I know I could find all the ingredients in our International District. Thank you so much for sharing one aspect of your beautiful life with us. Ô∏è
I feel so attracted to this lifestyle as if it‚Äôs how humans are naturally supposed to live
I love seeing Grandma chilling out on the shaded swing. Every elderly person should have that opportunity for rest after a long life. And have lovely well prepared meals for them. 
Hi Lizipi .. I am in love with your cooking ... you enjoy everything ... the leaves and roots ... the stalks the barks .. you don‚Äôt throw anything away ... I am loving and learning a lot from your videos .. .you .
This is what you gotta watch when you‚Äôre feeling lazy about which drive through to go to for lunch, THEN, end up going to the supermarket and buying things to cook, THEN, feeling like you did something great by cooking, THEN, realizing you still really didn‚Äôt and how you have it so well off in comparison to what others do to make a meal, THEN, AND FINALLY THEN, you actually realize you‚Äôre NOT that well off since no matter how much easier it is to get things as quickly and easy as you do, this person here has so much more skills and rewards of feeling the feeling she must feel on a daily basis from always learning, doing and providing for her Family, in THIS way. AMAZING!!! My goodness 
That food looks so delicious and she makes it look so easy to cook! But I could never do that here in the U.S.

She can cook all my meals....wow she makes cooking look beautiful. ..a work of art
The best part about all of these videos is that every single piece of food and every single ingredient is 100% fresh, healthy, and pesticide/steroid free. I envy that the most of all, to be honest.
To be honest, I love watching her videos. I believe that she worked hard for it and every single bit of her works proved it. While scrolling through the comments, I saw a lot of malicious comments criticizing her. I mean, I know most people wouldn‚Äôt know whether this is true or not. But you can at least support her for this beautiful video? Well maybe if you hate to support then don‚Äôt watch it. I love watching her videos and that is it for me. Writing such awful comments made me think of how cruel can a mouth/mind be? Please, she never disturbs any of you. So please, don‚Äôt hurt her.
She's really amazing. Uses each and every thing fully and never wastes anything. Hats off to you ma'am

Watching your videos motivate me so much to do anything! It just make me want to do activities and not to be lazy

I suddenly remember my mom, she loves eating river snails. We would always go to the river to catch snails every Sunday for her. Nice video 
La ni√±a m√°s linda y hermosa su creatividad no tiene l√≠mites inteligente y trabajadora y hermosa una rara combinaci√≥n
I didn‚Äôt even know bamboo was edible! Wow! 
I love watching her cook what is grown on their farm, everything is totally fresh and organic and probably tastes fantastic! 
She‚Äôs one of the most amazing and talented girl I‚Äôve ever seen on YouTube.. she fed not only her granny but the soul of every viewers.. this is immortality I want to live in that place Ô∏èÔ∏è  i wish more power and strength for u and granny..Ô∏è
Belo prato de refei√ß√£o,
I notice you always do more then one meal for every video, and always keep me enjoying them. No doubt you are absolutely the best. 
Not only are her videos tranquilizing to the point of transcendence, you learn a lot, too.

In some places in the Philippines, this bamboo shoots are called Dabung or Labung to some while in Indonesia where i lived for almost 3years they call their bamboo shoots Rebung. Most other countries in asia also cook this bcos its highly nutritious and one can really experiment with this bamboo shoot as a main ingredient.

I have never tried this dish but I already know it's my favourite food - can anybody else relate?
I wish I could have this kind of life. I once lived in a place like this growing up and miss it.
She has an unconditional love for her grandmother, taking care of her and feeding her with healthy nutritious home cooking !
Seems like I was in a dream for a moment. This background, her yard, flowers, jungle & specially she heals me up 
watching her cooking while eating was so satisfying, my ordinary food become delicious because what? we shud appreciate what nature gave us to eat.
Such soothing simplicity!  True art in the process of living.  Thank You
Eating so healthy and fresh.  I wish I could eat that good!
There are so many of these in my area and they are delicious for everyday food

How she does so many things in one day is beyond me. She's just amazing.
What I like the most about Ziqi's videos: 1. she is so pretty and pleasant to look at; 2. the food looks so beautiful; 3. the countryside, the environment... everything in her videos, from the person to the environment, are just so beautiful and pure. I am glad that there are no men in her videos except the occasional appearance of the camera man.
All of videos in this channel always catch my eyes every second of that.....

Wonderful creation...
i'm actually more amazed that there is so much land to have a lifestyle like that. in this day and age to have that much land isn't easy.

I was quite surprised with the words she used in the Vietnamese subtitles
I like it and this video , It's nice
Everything she has is reusable or can be given back to the earth. I love this channel. It's everything we can only dream for the world to be.
All her videos remind me my childhood. Very peaceful ver organic which the life should be.
It‚Äôs really natural & pure with healthy weather..
My childhood was like this scene..
Love your video! You've brought vigor and energy to me.
Wonderful nature, i really miss my childhood memories in the village
I want this type of lifestyle ..I love it..
An interesting observation: many western families grow beautiful flowers in their gardens, but in a Chinese garden you are much more likely to see a great variety of vegetables such as peppers, tomatoes, eggplants, etc: just enough to supply a small family. They are as colorful and pretty. I believe such style reflects certain aspects of Chinese culture and philosophy of life. Grown up in China, I have always been pursuing a quiet, peaceful and self-sufficient life. And I found it in this film.

I think this is what we call "inner peace" - all of us, literally, are desperately pursuing some kind of life like this. It is escapism but not 100 percent, as it is more positive. Really really nice, heart-warming video. Thank you.
Suka sekali sama kehidupan yg dishare,seperti masih alami,apa apa dari alam,,,kerennn,,
Life is beautiful n peaceful when we connect with nature.. so relaxing..
looks so good, just makes me hungry.  it's accompanied by rice must be delicious. And the place is still natural.

You doing a remarkable job and there are some similarities to your way of life here in Morocco but we do things slightly different
I can imagine why people love her videos. They are satisfying.
Esta s√∫per delicioso
Que fofu 
Mantap, kreatif,dan kelihatan enak, terimakasih bunda  
I watched this like 3x already and still not tired of it. I wonder if she made those jars too and her knife and her kitchen. 
And I miss the talent
I miss the creativity
I miss the simplicity 
I miss the hard work
I miss the newness
I miss the beauty
I miss the love
I miss the real life
I miss the simple cooking
I miss the weather 
I miss liziqui and grand mom
Thank you for your hard work and effort to make us happy, love youÔ∏è
I grew up living like this and let me tell you, it IS hard...I don't know how the heck she makes it look glamorous 
I love the way she made this video - no talking, but let the sounds fulfill screen
She is phenomenal girl. Nice, gentle , strong, industries. She can do everything!!  I love her very much. 
So nice to see u nourishing grandma with food and love
I am surprised, becoz pickle made of bamboo shoots is an Assamese traditional cuisine (Indian) . We call it 'gaaz khorisa ' in Assamese

highly skilled video creators. their works remind me of human way of lives across the world in 17 to 18 centuries
Reminds me of grandmas pickled bamboo shoot (À∂Àô·µïÀôÀ∂)
In tripura we used to talk in kokborok and we called it "muya" you can also cook with baking soda istead if using oil and it tastes so good
Hope can see he cook again on new recepis 
As a European, I have never had the tangent with the specific food  to the area you are from, what you cook, I call healthy food, all kinds of nutrients and vitamins etc, exactly what the body needs. I really like your lifestyle, even if you do not show it all, but seeing from the big perspective you lead a healthy life, we should take an example from you. greetings from Romania :)

The most amazing are her beautiful hands, impossible to believe that she performs so much labor. First of all it tells that she has a perfect control of her very skillful hands, correct grip of every tool, perfect coordination and rhythm, accuracy, experience. My farther was also that way: he was an amateur carpenter, a gardener, an artist,  he could fix anything and yet I don't remember a single bristle, a cut of injury to his hands: they were handsome, strong always implacably clean hands of a man and a Creator.

This is my first time watching her videos,  and I must say, it's very inspiring and how lucky she is to have those wonderful ingredients within reach, or so.
My first try with luosifen wasn't pleasant due to the strong scent. Months later I tried again and I got hooked. But I can only purchase the instant package from the store and that's not good to consume frequently. I wish I could try the real one soon.

Bamboo shoot is also one of the most popular vegetables in Northeast India. We farment or dry it and cook it with pork.
Shes has the calmest videos so relaxing
the real question is when shes gonna drop a cookbook! every time i watch a video, i have to leave and cook something bc everything she makes looks DELICIOUS and it makes me hungry lmao
I was often busy or engaged in other things! 
Yet, whenener I come here, it is so soothing and calm!

Could you please tell me if any of the locals are collecting Bamboo seeds? I would like to grow it in our country.
Indonisian: In Indonesia, we call this bamboo root as rebung. we process it into various dishes, the taste wonderful.
Korean: It's our food. We dont''t want other people to cook it.

Bamboo is such a strong tree. My sister has them growing in her backyard...in Alabama 
Beautiful cooking Ô∏èÔ∏è
A pretty show of how to cook in a peculiar way,using peculiar utensils and having strange and pretty recipes in mind!!!!!
Grandma makes me very happy!

I just love Asian food. Last year I visited the Philippines for 3 weeks. My next stop will definitely will be Japan, China or Korea. Asian people are so friendly and kind.
Oiee gosto seus vidios  e de olha vc cozinhando
Nothing better than to wake up on a Sunday morning here in England & see Li Ziqi..;-))
In Nepal, we call that bamboo root as Tama. It is sour plus has a very good fragrance. Here is a superstition that Tama shouldn't be cut by the people having children as it is said that Cutting the Tama  is like killing your son or daughter. So, only people who doesn't have child could cut them!
It would be nice to list ingredients and there benefits..love the dog n kitty's

These videos are amazing. I would give anything for a woman like her.
Delicious!! Just a little bit of everything to make it perfect ;)
The sounds, the visuals... everything seems so peaceful! I wish I could spend a month there just to detox and get back close with nature.
Thanks for your efforts

I admire this girl because she‚Äôs at good farmer and cooking and she takes care of her Grandmother very well,god bless you girl.
In this video, at the end when grandma and zizi are eating, I realized she didn‚Äôt share the pot of river snail noddles with grandma!!!! LOL   she ate it all, the put the clay pot by her and ate it, when grandma reached out for some, got none and zizi gave her an egg!!!!!!!!! Poor grandma didn‚Äôt get any of the soup!

Grabe, buhay walang gadyet.  Amazing!
That bamboo shoot we call it "Labong" here in philippines.  It's yummy when you cook it with coconut milk 
I love your videos!
We would all like to see more Liziqi  videos. I have seen her earlier videos when she had to do the whole video by herself. She is hard working and talented. Those who are skeptical about her abilities should spend time with her. I admire her.
Greetings from the U.S.A.
Watching you doing this, feels like living in genshin impact

While we spend hundreds of dollar try to buy what so called "organic food" Liziqi just pick her ingredients in the backyard.  It's awesome.
Your granny so bless with u with her.

I may not be able to live just like her but she inspires me to do more myself and rely on stores just a bit less.  Raised garden beds, fix things, use natural items, etc.

Yes, I am a Chinese. Those dishes are edible after pickling! It tastes good! Sour, crisp
Maybe people here don't know, but luoshifen is super smelly because of fermented bamboo shoots used for the noodles. But when you eat, the smell goes away. Put it 1 feet of you and stop eating might cause you to gag you're not used to the smell. But otherwise it's good. The soup stock is usually made from snails, so it's seafoody.

Brazilian cuisine is the result of a mixture of European, indigenous and African ingredients.  Many of the components of the recipes and preparation techniques are of indigenous origin, having undergone modifications by the Portuguese and slaves from Africa.  These made adaptations of their typical dishes replacing the missing ingredients with local correspondents.  The Brazilian feijoada, a typical dish of the country, is an example of this.  The slaves brought to Brazil since the middle of the 16th century added elements such as palm oil and couscous to national cuisine.  And the waves of immigrants received by the country between the 19th and 20th centuries, coming in large numbers from Europe, brought some novelties to the national menu and concomitantly strengthened the consumption of various ingredients.

 Daily food, made in three meals, involves the consumption of coffee with milk, bread, fruits, cakes and sweets for breakfast, beans and rice for lunch - the Brazilian's basic meal, to which are sometimes added pasta  , meat, salad and potatoes - and, for dinner, soups and also the various regional foods.

 Distilled beverages were brought by the Portuguese or, like cacha√ßa, made on the land.  Wine is also widely consumed, sometimes added to water and sugar, in the well-known sangria.  Beer in turn began to be consumed in the late 18th century and is today one of the most common alcoholic drinks.

 The most visible regional cuisines belong to the states of Minas Gerais and Bahia, with Minas Gerais cuisine marked by European influence in delicacies and dairy products such as tropeiro beans (also a dish from S√£o Paulo cuisine), cheese bread (which is equivalent to Paraguayan chipa,  differing in format) and the cheese from minas frescal, and Bahian cuisine due to the presence of African delicacies such as acaraj√©, abar√° and vatap√°.  Pernambuco's cuisine stands out for its so-called "Pernambuco sweets", that is, the sweets developed during the colonial and imperial periods in its sugar mills such as the bolo de bolo, Souza Le√£o cake and top hat, and also for drinks  and savory delicacies discovered or probably originated in the state, such as cacha√ßa, beiju and feijoada √† BRASILEIRA.
Great viewing, even if it‚Äôs not exactly truthful. Highly successful image!

It used to be like this man was just uncontented and turned into a life full of difficulties.
I would trade every cent I have to live in that place. Who needs a car? Who needs a mansion? Who needs a million? if you can live in a beautiful place with a peaceful environment. I would even be more contented.
