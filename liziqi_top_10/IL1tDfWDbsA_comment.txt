Imagine having a daughter like her. Her grandma must be very happy to have a caring and very talented granddaughter like her 
I wish I could have a garden like hers and has every ingredient out of the tree. How healthy and natural

Liziqi is living the ideal life as it should be and she is all happy and relaxed by staying connected to nature.
I am so proud oh her and I love every dish she makes️
Her garden is absolutely stunning!!! She is so unbelievably talented to keep all this going!!!
i truly have no idea how these videos are done and what is happening behind the scences but. the cinematography, the music and audio editing in general, the cuts and the pace ... heaven truly. thank you to whoever is making these. puts me at peace.
I know this video is meant to showcase her garden and cooking, but more than anything, this makes me miss my grandma so much! I wish I could share one more meal with her ️
Gracias por poner los subtítulos en español me encanta todo lo que haces es un lindo ejemplo de vida saludos de Argentina Buenos Aires 
The way she is being taken care of, I would bet that the grandma is well over 100 years of age. Once again another video that has left me totally mesmerized!
Olá LI ZIQI, todos os vídeos, que tenho visto, são importantes para mim, mas este apresenta alguns alimentos de que gosto como o quiabo, o jiló, o tomate. Ummm! Deve ter ficado uma delícia! Eu vejo você sempre!
    Hoje, dia 28 de janeiro de 2021, eu retorno para rever este vídeo maravilhoso e aprender mais um pouco coa a LI ZIQI. Eu vejo você sempre
    Fabre-Brasil.
Takes me to a beautiful place each time I see her videos. Delicious dishes. Liziqi and her Grandma have such an incredible appreciation for the food they grow and enjoy. Inspiring cooking and good healthy food. How lovely.xx
If Liziqi ever reads this, I just want her to know that I cannot express in words how much I love these videos. The quality is so good, and very therapeutic.
She is doing a great effort literally I am shocked after watching it that how she did every thing very neatly and legibly.I am really proud of her and infact I appreciate her.Keep it up SIS
Sister Liziqi, you can make tomato sauce to put on spaghetti. In Italy we use the fresh tomato sauce for both pasta and pizza. You can make pizza in your oven where you bake the bread. Grandma is going to love some Italian food for a change!

Woooooooo!!!! increíble esta subtitulado al español, me encanta este programa por la naturaleza y la originalidad que tiene consigo, éxitos  nunca pierdan sus esencias.
Much much better than the "Hi friends we gonna cook some healthy food todayyy" kind of shows.
If looking at these food makes me feel healthy , I wonder how good it must feel to really eat them
Hummm que delícia de comidas!!!
She literally has every vegetable we can think of in her backyard. Such a blessed life 
We love watching your videos, because of you I STARTED planting vegetables. You are my inspiration
So satisfying to watch how everything is literally from farm to table 
She's not only a Youtuber. She's indeed an influencer 🇵🇭

hermoso lugar, hermosas personas y comida de dioses, amo sus videos, gracias por compartir!
Просто прелесть и природа и девушка все умеет.умничка красавица..
И музыка ..отдыхаешь от души
Спасибо .
I just love to watch her the way she cooks its very satisfying
She's the reason why I started my own garden!
And now, I'm hungry watching her cooking. That bread looks really delicious. 
Медитирую перед сном после рабочего дня под её видео. Очень красиво)
I never thought it would be so relaxing and nice to watch your videos. Wish you all the best Lizqi!
Какя красота ,какая  природа красивая, какая девушка хозяйка ,как все умело  делает ,просто рай на земле !!!  
Eres un gran ejemplo para la juventud que siempre está aburrida o cansada si siempre hay algo para hacer, eres afortunada al tener a tu abuelita uno recibe algunos conocimientos de ella.
Amo ver seus vídeos.  Uma paz... sabedoria. .. que vontade de comer tudo e ficar magrinha que nem você ️
I am really happy to see her grandmother is healthy. I hope I can cook delicious food to my grandmother too.
Parabéns  seus vídeos  são  magníficos.  Amor a terra e o que faz com perfeição.  Amo a natureza. Abraço
It;s like she got the best garden and farm in the world. Also she's doing it from the very scratch. Plant the seeds, maintain them, growing them, harvest them and cook them. All fresly picked. This make me so envy.
This is another incredibly good, brilliant, beautiful, and INSPIRING video from Ms. Liziqi (who is also beautiful, hardworking, and brilliant.).  We over here in Los Angeles, love your videos so much.  The videos are also very therapeutic, soothing, and relaxing.  Thank you so much for sharing all your videos, and for all your hard work. 
Trying to make my own ruby sapphire sauce today. Liziqi got me wanting to explore what can be done with fresh tomatoes.
Each and every fruits and vegetables she is eating is from her own garden 
Isn't that amazing 
It's truly a blessing 
Me: Watch her videos at midnight before I going to sleep because it's so relaxing
This is the stuff of dreams! The garden is amazing in its produce and in the way it is kept so visually perfect. What an amazing job she has done maintaining it. I have no doubt it actually takes full time work, though she makes it look effortless.
You're incredible, I'm from Italy and everytime you make a new video i'm the happiest person in the world!! I also have advised my whole family to watch your videos and now we all sit together and watch them. Keep going we value you!!
Какая сказка...Потрясающие видео,удивительно нежные истории...очень люблю!Благодарю от всей души!
your so amazingly brilliant and i really salute you for having such kind of skills youre one in a million, GODBLESS YOU AND YOUR GRANDMA!.
After watching your video, I really think you are awesome. I not only saw a lot of delicious food, but also saw the video that you worked hard to present to everyone.
Gosto muito dos vídeos dessa mulher 
I love her home town... Rich of fruits and vegetables... And the ambiance... So fresh and relaxing
Just when you think everything is materialistic, there is this channel. What a beautiful person, soul, place. This brought me peace. ️
Adoro esses videos!!! O lugar é  incrivel!!!
Que hermoso lugar me encanta

I feel very relaxed while watching these kind of videos......how simple life they are living & preparing their food.....
Você  é maravilhosa, sou sua fã !!!
In two weeks, i have finished watching all her videos.. So addicting.. I want more of her new video.. 
I’ve got all the women at work hooked on to this YouTube channel. We all dissect the episodes and talk about how amazing lizi qi is and how we all wished we were like her but can’t be arsed going to the grocery store let alone do the gardening. 
Your videos are so calming. The music the lifestyle the everyday routines. I just love it all!!!
Everything seem so complete and when ever she want to cook the ingredients already serve at her garden 
Porque não colocam legendas em português? Gostaria de saber o nome de alguns ingredientes usados por Liziq. Gosto muito dos vídeos dela, mas sem entender nada do que eles falam, fica difícil!
Felucudades. Esos vídeos son espectaculares . Que bueno que los tradujeran. Para conocer los ingredientes y el modo de preparación. Al igual la forma de sembrar . Me sorprendio lo de las flores. Acaso no son tóxicas.?
Sou brasileiro mas essa mulher eu tiro o chapéu pra ela muito trabalhadeira obediente e gentil simpática com a vozinha dela ou a mãezinha não sei mas parabéns
Variety of vegetables and fruits in her garden ️ Amazing
I would love to see a video of her tending her garden  Everything looks so healthy
Love the way she takes care of her grandmother ️
One of my favorite channels, I love tomatoes, I love your grandmother, she is so cute.  Blessings to you and your family.
Your garden also amazing Liziqi. I can see you're really working hard at home and in your garden. You are a garden fairy :))
She is so lucky that she can eat many fruits, vegetables and that also fresh
Esta menina planta é colhe é come do seu próprio trabalho ela vale ouro brasileiro eu desejo  felicidades para ela
Liziqui...eres genial me gustan todos tus videos,tienes muchos conocimientos y habilidades para ser tan joven.sigue así,un fuerte abrazo desde España.
God bless you and your family with gud health and you continue to bring peace to everyone of us watching you do it
How can anyone give these videos a thumbs-down? I love watching the various dishes come together, and the location is just beautiful.
Everything what she need, always available in her garden 
Nossa q delícia ,fiquei com vontade, obrigada minha mínina
Que hermoso esa ver esa buena cosecha y aprender a utilizar en distintas preparaciones me alegro mucho  de verla como lo hace con esa buena actitud y lo fácil que lo hace
She has a whole market in her garden.. she us soooo amazing 
I enjoy so much watching your videos, your grandma is such a lovely and adorable lady. Big hug and kiss from Spain!! You have a new fan!!!
It's like i'm watching a historical drama everytime! All her videos has this calming, nostalgic effect that leaves a good feeling in your heart
Que hermosura todo el huerto las siembras los animales y los jardines los observo con frecuencia porque me gustan mucho,ficidades desde Venezuela,Dios las bendiga a las 2.

Her videos resonate deep within each of our souls without the need for words or language. She brings the YouTube community the peace it sometimes needs.
Sos genial! Aquí, en Buenos Aires, los tomates que venden ya no tienen sabor a tomate. 
Un pedido especial, sería muy bueno para nosotros, lo de habla latina, agregar subtítulos. Saludos cordiales
The sound when she plucks the vegetables off the plants is just so beautiful.
I can’t even water my one succulent properly lol. Jokes aside it feels so nice to harvest things from your yard and cook it knowing that it’s as fresh as you can get and it’s something handpicked by you. We have had basil, kaffir lime leaves, and lemon grass. It’s not much but it’s nice
無償に見たい時が  定期的に有り、そんな時は 繰返し見ています。何度見ても飽きないです。見ていて、安心感が、あります( =＾ω＾)日本語の字幕が出ていて、びっくりとても嬉しいです。分かりやすくなりました。
Liziqi has all of the skills of a well-seasoned Michelin chef. Her modesty doesn't bely her skills to a well-trained eye. She is the well-trained, genuine article and we appreciate her for her skills.
The Garden and house looks so beautiful. I would love it if she showed it in a video (house Tour), as long as she is comfortable with that
Love the ️Garden️ got Everything needed for Cooking . Calm vibe u get watching this video is awesome 
She has the entire grocery store in her garden!! it's so impressive!
how great it is having those fresh vegetables 
I love those pots, those ovens, that kitchen
that gatrden and she does all by herself
She is living the life we all would love to lead, almost too good to believe but I sure would miss her if she was not there in video, stay safe young lady and I look forward to seeing you tomorrow.
I have to see these videos behind the scenes and liziqi's daily routine cause dude, it's just all perfect
Love watch all episodes. Always dream of such pure life without city pollution. Very peaceful. Also she is vert talented. Pls share the location of this chines village
This is honestly the life I've always dreamed of. I can't imagine how it must feel like to live among this beauty and peace every day and get to make everything yourself.
Hi Liziki my name is Salam and i always watch ur videos and uploads. I really like what you do with all the works you put in with your grandma.. i always try to apply whatever is possible ways in my day to day activities. I am really proud of you and send you and ur grandma all the love and best wishes all the way from Lebanon
This girl can do anything. Who else feels happy while watching her videos? When you can just smile and think that this is the life I want. So light and peaceful watching her videos. ️
So inspiring about the life.so simple and full of peace and tranquility.i love the food.from philippines full of love.thank you.for your video.
Тихий восторг от ее дома, от ее сада и огорода, от бабушки и от животных, ну и от кухни , конечно...от ее золотых рук.
О мой бог! есть ли что-то, чего не умеют делать ее прекрасные ручки? :)
So talented!! I have watched most of her videos, the way she’s making everything it just makes me so enjoyable and relax. Nowadays the majority of people use electronic devices to bake something for the cook or anything but she doesn't use any of them. I am just impressed with her hard work. I hope people get her attention and learn. Keep doing it.
The tomatoes we have at the store is a different type to the tomato that local farmers produce.  Supermarket tomatoes need to travel and be stored, so their skin is tougher, their meat is tougher,  and they are plucked while still green.  Local farm tomatoes are plucked when ripe and the skin is thinner.  The taste of the supermarket tomato is sour and not as flavorful.  A local farm tomato is sweet like a fruit with a soft texture.  If you want good tomatoes, you have to find the fruit type and grow it yourself.  Otherwise you gotta find a local farmer who produces and sell locally.
This place is heaven for me and to those who love cooking. Literally they have every ingredients you needed..
Love us videos.keep do you.and making all those wonderful  foods.most I couldn't  eat because of the spices. Plus I  am  allergic to garlic. 
Admiro  a lo de liziqi. Todo lo que hace se ve delicioso. Saludos desde  mi país México Puebla mi estado
I watch raindrops, hear sleep podcasts but this one after 10-20mins of watching I can immediately doze off peacefully. So relaxing.
I wish she could share some of her cuisine with us .
This is the very first video that I watched. Now I'm addicted. Here's to more videos ♡-♡
The world could be falling into a black hole and I would still be here quite happily watching these videos.  Such an amazing insight into your life and culture. Thank you for sharing your life with us 
They have every kind of vegetable in their garden. I wish I could have garden like her.love from me
Thank you. We watched your video when we were due for prayer prayer meeting in Feb 2020 and we're blessed to see your harvest and also took your form for prayer. God bless you. My austin Elijah is in his teens and was looking for roses.thank you.
I'm thanking my little friend, for recommending me this channel, right after I'm done watching this video.
This video is a proof that I'm going to fall for this channel real soon. ^_^
Best thing about her videos that its so peaceful calm ️
I would love to have a garden like yours but where i live it's hard to grow many vegetables
I wish I can live a life she has. Surrounded by vegetables and fruits and flowers and nature and everything nice. That's my dream life to be honest 
I can see my mother in her. They are kind of similar. Very hardworking and diligent people and also a great cook
I enjoy watching these videos and now I could see what the dish is with the captioning turned on. I was wondering if Liziqi can add captioning for what she is picking in the garden, some of the fruits and vegetables are recognizable, but not all of them.
Muito legal 
Приятного просмотра всем! Просто отдыхает человек. Больше слов нет.
ne kadar gerçekçi ve doğal bir video olmuş hele fasulyelerin tek tek özenle dizilişi bu videonun doğallığını ortaya koymuş :)
How can people dislike this,I just don't get it!Her videos are amazing
Gracias q ponen subtitulo en español bendiciones 
I wish I could eat the food she made once in my life.
Her videos always makes me feel unease. I am struggling to the new normal now. No stable internet connection for online class. My youngest siblings that doesnt have proper equipment. Its a harsh year.
I'm ready grateful i get to watch your vids. Calming and relaxing
Your food looks so amazing and delicious!
If i have given a chance i would live in this place how i wish im there also its like a paradise to me while im watching her vlog
Meu sonho viver assim
Удивительная страна!!! Не устаю восхищаться..
I could say this girl is living a very wonderful life. So satisfying and peaceful.
soy de el Salvador  y me encanta ver sus vídeos me gusta como codina es un lugar muy lindo bendiciones
she literally has a whole market in her yard :')
Very nice hostess , you cook so delicious and beautifully !  You have cooked ruddy bread in the oven and a lot of very tasty dishes!️
When i saw liziqi and her grandma 
I missed my grandma which she already pass away. She stay in the village too and she used to plant alot of things in her garden fruits,flowers,gingers,sweet potatoes and everytime we visit her she always cooked for us.miss her so much 
Realmente me encantan.todos sus vídeos, gracias por los subtítulos en español, Ud es encantadora, será que solamente en China habrá mujeres así?
the most beautiful about her is how she treats her grandma
It is such peaceful and relaxing to watch the video... lovely and sweet moment when 子柒 calling out '奶奶' 
My parents really love nature I wish I can give them this type of life in the future
Striving harder to have this!! Thanks for being such an inspiration!!
Mình thích cuộc sống như vậy. Vừa yên bình,thỏai mái, nhẹ nhàng, thoáng và trong sạch, có đất đai trồng trọt. Tuyệt vời quá đi.
So peaceful life. I wish I could live like you.️️
This is literally what I've been waiting for the last 2 weeks! We definitely need a longer video.
Tuy mình không hiểu ngôn ngữ của bạn, nhưng xem nhiều video của bạn làm tôi có nhiều động lực trong cuộc sống, rất thích giản dị như thế vì mình củng là người miền quê.. mong bạn ra nhiều video 
Love the way she called her grandma. So cute and warming
Como essa jovem  é  virtuosa !
Pero que lugar más hermoso.!!!
Felicitaciones excelente
 
I love watching your videos. What kind of fuel do you use in your small clay pot? It would be great if you could do a video about all the cooking utensils and methods you use. Your wok station is fascinating (from a western women's point of view). I assume it was built either by your grandfather or another ancestor! You use vegetables I have never seen before! Thank you for sharing your culture.
Hello Liziqi,  it's been a long time you are not posting any more videos. We love your channel.
Owning a farm like this is the best thing anyone can ask for. Everything comes natural and healthy! I love it!
OMG !!!
How is she able to do this much work...I am even become tired of making a single packet of maggie but she makes whole lunch and dinner with new dishes
Her work speaks not she! This literally makes liziqi unique !!!
You are really great.. grandma is so lucky️ nice vedio nice channel nice girl.. everything is perfect️
First time watching this video and feeling very very far away from this so called developed world. Thnx for this video. I can't spell your name cz i don't know your language but wanna say you that you have done very satisfactory thing for many of the persons who have already forgotten the world that you nd your family own..
I am very happy with the energy we created in the studio today
I can't fathom how many kinds of vegetables, fruits and herbs you have there?  Though you danced around effortlessly cooking and cutting,  you must have spent tons of hours tending it 24/7, AMAZING!  Almost 2 million views already, my gosh!  I agree with most of the viewers, after a day's work, I find your videos so relaxing to watch. THANK  YOU for sharing your life with us.
I couldn't help smiling while watching her videos. 
好想尝尝她做的东西
Deus te abençoe te cubra com o manto sagrado você todos nós  obrigada  por me ensina  tantas coisas  sou Maria Iraci  tenho  61anos  e você  tem me animado  muito  a não  ficar  parada tive  3 avc  e nunca  parei de trabalha
Ôi ước gì mình cũng có vườn  cà chua giống vậy rất thích bạn ơi.chúc bạn nhiều sức khỏe
Love your kungfu move! I can see how hard you have worked to create everything. Thank you for letting us into your life  I hope you and your family prosper and stay well. 

My and all of my family and friends enjoy your videos so much. Please know that you bring peace and joy to a lot of people. Don’t mind when people say something negative. You are an amazing person.
Tudo lindo e maravilhoso
Everything is so peaceful and full of natural beauty.....Love your videos️......Lots of love from India🇮🇳
Qué hermosos son todos sus videos
I'm from the USA and I just love watching these videos I don't speak her language but she puts me in such a relaxation that it doesn't really matter she is awesome in my book thank you for these videos I'm a better person because of them
That grandma will surely live a long long life!! 
This is a total meditation for me.
What a wonderful world!
Que hermosos tomates!
Owww u have every varieties of fresh vegetables.. That's so cool & healthy.. 
We need to live a life like her, it is much sustainable than being modern
i love everything about liziqi’s vlog..you are true content creator.love from japan!!!️️️️
She's just so beautiful and self independent, I hope someday I'll find a woman like this! And Together make our own organic garden in our home high in the mountains  Thank you Liziqi for being such an inspiring person! Love you
Hi LiZiQi, i really want to make your Red Sapphire Sauce.  Did you add sugar at first?  How long do you store it to produce pectin?  How long do you simmer it?  Thank you so much!
É tudo muito lindo
吃的都是自己栽種的蔬果，應該會很健康，長命百歲
How I wish I have garden like yours Liziqui .All natural love it
I was a long time back I come back to this video.....I really like her green vegetables garden ........so many ingredients I really just love it
The amount of care and effort you put into your videos is truly inspirational. It is always a pleasure to watch your videos. You are amazing! ️
She is really staying in a nice environment. I just love that place
Помидорки просто чудо! 
How can one person know how to be pretty, do everything, AND have such a cute grandma?!
Grandma looks younger and healthier since you've been taking care of her
О такой жене только мечтать, шедевр
Who else loved her DIY oven??   her videos are so relaxing 
She works harder everyday than probably 99% of Americans. I don't know how she even makes time to edit a video. And she somehow does it all in flip flops! Amazing.
This is like the garden of Eden.  Every vegetable, fruit, and livestock imaginable behind your back door. I lost count for what she have in the backyard.  For me, I get my stuff from the supermarket but it still don't have as much as what Liziqi have.
独特的な世界観ぽいのが好きです！
とても癒されます。
あと料理どれも美味しそう(*´꒳`*)
Здравствуйте все очень вкусно ,но некоторые индигриенты не знаю , можно на русском перевод пожалуйста ,мне очень понравилось,и всегда смотрю
Clip nào của Liziqi mình đều xem hết rất hay nên học hỏi ,chúc bạn mãi thành công
I wish i had this kind of backyard.. healthy living and fresh and all natural...
All your videos are nice to watch ️️
She's a very knowledgeable chef. She knows about farming, building,  and cooking. Such a wonderful person she is
Realmente me tranquiliza sus videos 
Completamente inspirador
Maravilhoso seus videos
Такая хрупкая женщина,но как все ловко ,красиво у нее получается!!!Такое блаженство вокруг нее!!!
Fantástico....linda 
I'm happy I found this channel.  It is so relaxing to watch.
Te admiro mucho te respeto me encanta no canso de verlos me entran algún día aré una de tus recetas en contrar los ingredientes que son que sepa riquísimo buenas noches o tardes amiga Noemi
Мне нравятся все ваши видео, не могу оторваться от вашего канала!
I would love to know how many people it takes to grow all this food?? I know she works so hard all the time but there is no way she plants, weeds, cultivates all this on her own. She must have a huge community behind her that makes all this happen and look so effortless. No disrespect, just pointing out that it takes a community to achieve this vision.
I seriously want to learn cooking and gardening from her. I'm currently trying to improve my photography and art skills!!
Tantas frutas de uma só vez,cada frutas têm sua estação
Wish i could have a place like this where i could plan different kind of vegetables and fruits etc.  watching from philippines. 
Onde fica esse shangrila?
Paisagens bucólicas 
Verduras e frutas que crescem abundantemente 
E uma jovem que encara desde levantar cercas, plantar, colher e ainda preparar pratos apetitosos!!!
E cuidar da sua querida vovó.
Li Ziqi 
Is the most fascinating woman I have ever watched. 
She can do everything with the
things that are a gift from the earth. From building something, marinating different foods and cooking delicious dishes fresh from the earth.
Love your videos.  Thank you for making them. They are relaxing.  Bless your heart, you are so busy. Do you ever take time off, have a lazy day?
Как завидую бабушке!!
3:25 my mom also make this we call tomato chutney 
С Удовольствием наблюдаю за девушкой Какая умничка ВСЁ у НЕЁ так складно и ладно Молодец ,красавица ,Хозяюшка ЗДОРОВЬЯ ТЕБЕ И ТВОИМ БЛИЗКИМ
Liziqui you are awesome I wish I had a working n cooking skills like you.
My dad ordered me to start planting tomatoes today because he said we have to grow our own food/veggies now (cause of coronavirus). I’ve never knew that there are so many tomatoes and they all look so healthy..I wish my tomatoes will grow like that ;-;
When I watch your video it make me feel at home, living with happiness in a family. It's also my vision that make smile all around the world and feeling safe and peace in relexed time.
sizi izlerken huzur buluyorum orda olmak istiyorum resmenn
Добрый день Лизики, простите может быть не правильно написала ваше имя, спасибо большое что вы есть, вы для такой мотиватор, у вас золотые ручки, а какая у вас природа вы наверное живете в раю!!!!! Очень мне понравилась ваша печка- кошка( cat) я тоже хочу себе сделать такую же уж очень она необычная, всего вам самого наилучшего!!!!!!!!

Tem Việt Nam xem chị . ước đc 1 lần sang sống với chị thưởng thức cảnh đẹp núi đồi cây trái .
I swear, I don't know what it taste like, but that kind of bread she makes with different nuts, makes me want to eat every loaf.  I just had dinner but I'm already hungry.
Liziqi videos are amazing and relaxing
You are amazing... thank you for sharing your inspiration... please say hello to grandma and family
You are so talented and hard working.. Love from India
I binge-watch this channel actually. I live in France and my country became a horrible mess. Violence, oppression, our freedom is dead, I wish I could leave and go somewhere else, somewhere with quiet nature and nice people like Liziqi.
Son unos de los TOPGIRLS.Uno

Sun: ''Hotter'' 
Sugar: ''Sweeter'' 
Joonie: ''Cooler'' 
Yoongi: ''Butter'' 

Son unos de los mejores conciertos.#垃圾
you should make a video of your grandma she so cute, people would like to see how you care for her. I think it would motivate more people to do what you do . I think everything you do is probably for your grandma , your a hard working women who will never be poor because you work so hard. there for you will always have what you need , God bless : )
Beautiful your gardening and your cooking..everything...just awsome
I love her Garden it makes me feel like she's a magical fairy who takes care of a garden. Like in a storybook
She is very qualified...self reliance...farm to table eating...live food 
That bread looks amazing 
Her husband is gonna be extremely  lucky really
What an amazing girl
Salute to her
Respect for her
Does anyone know what the tomato varieties are called that Li ziqi is using? They are all so pretty and look delicious.
I love watching these videos , so tranquil and beautiful,  thank you.
Thank you so much Liziqi for sharing with us your beautiful videos. You are truly an angel who is beautiful on the inside and out  I am in awe,  you are so inspiring and hard working! Your garden is just thriving with so much variety and you have done so well to look after it all. I wish you and your Grandma all the happiness in the world 
Very beautiful...flowers vegetables in house..imagine if I were this... 
Amazingly  hard worker yet  beautifully soft and feminine the flowers are just so! lovely, garden is  amazing! Just makes you want to be there  
I really enjoy the silence and solitude yet it speaks volumes.
I am curious is there just herself and her nan, and who helps in the garden to plough plant and cultivate surely she doesn't do it all
If she does she is one amazing young women.
Just so enjoy watching.
Good evening, please post your shows with English subtitles.
Thank you and have a bless evening.
Would anyone know what type of oil she used for her salad dressing?? It looks amazing!
Так же как у нас помидоры огурцы салат базилик, так классно наблюдать за ней
I watch your videos every night before I sleep, so relaxing! I love them ️
Watching her videos is like I'm in another life
Как всё просто, мелодично и красиво..
I dont how much time i watched it............. And i started my own garden.... After my graduation i will expand it
I wish I lived there  I do love tomatoes ️
家裡跟菜園一樣~~要什麼有什麼~~真正的田園生活啊
Why she is so loved, because she is genuine, she only present the strong and creative parts of a woman, she  presents herself naturally and blend in with nature without emphasis her personal looks, just clean cut presentation of a great culture, simple but powerful!
Mil gracias por los subtítulos en español 
Uuuuuii los amo 
請允許我驚訝！
居然種有這麼多的番茄品種！
太厲害了！！
其實每個視頻都讓我覺得不可思議，太震撼了！感謝您讓我領略四季
Love You Liziqi Love From INDIA ️ SIMPLICITY , I am big FAN of you , i always watch your videos when i feel boaring , you are a hard-working person  🇮🇳
does anyone know how she is able to keep pests away from her crops, especially soft ones like her tomatoes????????? how do they all look so lovely  I'm assuming she doesn't use pesticides... for obvious reasons lol, based on her lifestyle, but maybe I'm just naive

Can we talk about how cute it was when she called her grandmother and give her those tomatoes????
She really work hard for her granny  I am so touched
Living with nature is amazing always
whoever disliked prob is jealous because she has a life of a princess insteaad of sitting on the couch all day and eating pizza just to waste our lives
I have a question from all of you who have followed from the beginning. Has the house structure changed from one of the older videos? It appeared to be a two story structure but no gaden area or all of the other lovely places she shows. I was just wondering if she did all of that  also.
kindly please subtitles your ingredients which you put to make such awesome dishes
I think we just had a mini tour of her garden. 
Very industrious video. So many things that you have to watch this again. 
Keep up the good work and have a good day.
Hola muchas felicidades, pon títulos en español, porque no se sabe que ingredientes pones a los alimentos que preparas. Por favor y gracias. 
Райский сад! 
Im so jealous that your vegetable market is just in the back of your house and everything is fresh..
ước gì có 1 khu vườn như cô ấy

Your video makes me inner peace, such a good environment, so beautiful lady and plant.
Her life is so peaceful, everything is available and she is genius

Пение сверчков прекрасны- рай и пение птиц.
As someone who hates tomatoes...she makes me want to start eating them.
Siempre me e preguntado como funciona esa especie de cocina que utiliza sobre la mesa es a gas madera carbon? Como es tan pequeña?
It is very interesting Chinese move you did. Thank you to let us know. I learned Karate, so in Heyan / Pinan Sandan the 6th and 7th part of moves are just as similar to this Kung Fu moves. Thank you for Kata Bunkai.
When she says 奶奶 its really heartwarming
I think what I admire the most.....is there is no currency exchanged......rather the barter system but more so independent farming, fishing, foraging.....sharing, caring for elders, building from raw materials........truly homesteading.......... I swear this is me in my past life.......I am too old to create such a utopia........ be blessed......
Đam mê quá, ra vườn là đầy đồ ăn.
It’s so crazy how there is parts of Asia that are so industrialized, and there’s other parts that are simple and natural
I love how she's cooking
I love it and so many types of vegatables is verry natural and safe..
I live in the countryside and it's impossible the tomato plants looks so perfect! All perfectly places... Usually is full of animals or fallen down or dirty by rain or dust... I mean nature is wild! But all the videos looks different.... And how the  be so perfectly soft?

All vegetable and fruit grow in her house. She is so talented girl.
It feels peace to see her videos.... 
I kind of expected to see an italian tomato sauce (idk why) and was really surprised to see a panettone looking bread instead.

Parabéns pela suas habilidades. Nova Odessa Estado de São Paulo Brasil
I wish I could hve a garden like this
The food looks delicious
I come from Sichuan China, which is not far from the vloger. My grandma used to own a garden in the countryside, however obviously much smaller than this one. I still missed the time when I visited grandma's home in the summer vocation. I always walked through the plants and expected the dishes she cook for me. She just passed away resently.
Thank you for your video to let me remember these good old time. And wish you and your grandma healthy and happy.
Everything she do is wonderful.
Love it! Everything is Fresh and Natural! These people are the richest people in the World! What a life they have!
Aduh kayaknya enak nih buah tomatnya salam budidaya dari Indonesia🇲🇨
I like her garden it's so beautiful 
I love the bowls and massive bamboo steamer!
What a life  Love from India ️
My wish is to live in such peaceful place .
When I was a little boy over 3/4 of a century ago, my grandmother used to prepare meals and canned foods out of the garden much the same way. It was not an easy life but it was fair.
I've just been completely hypnotized that was such and amazing video.

I don’t like tomatoes but this video might make me convert to worshipping them because look at how refreshing and wholesome those tomatoes are 
Truly amazing. So we don’t need granite counter tops and Bosch oven after all.

Wow I just thought about how cinematically skilled this is. She uses one shot for just a few seconds and constantly changes camera angles to best illustrate whatever's going on. Editing and getting content must  take forever

I wish she would adopt me as her sister for life..️️️️️️️

I love how you have different kinds of tomato... so pretty. They look so delicious.️
Прекрасная девушка,красивая природа,птички поют,вода журчит,разноцветная кукуруза,вкусные блюда. Хочу туда!!!
My two personalities 
Wanting to live like a witch in the forest away from everyone completely self reliant 
Wanting to live in the capital city and go out everyday
Some say she fakes it. Then she perfectly cuts meat, or harvests something, or builds something or show us skills that would fake years of practice and cannot be faked.
To be honest.. she is living the best life ever... Even better than luxurious flat and people
日本語の字幕ありがたいです
ありがとうございます！
Your gardens are so magical! I know they take a lot of work too, thanks so much for sharing these beautiful videos!
I want a wife like her

She’s living the life that i waaaant! Simple, peaceful and quiet life together with loved ones
土壤非常肥沃，蔬菜看起来非常美丽。
Wow so many tomatoes of different varieties. ️️
Thank you so much for sharing your way of living I miss my grama grandfather  so much ...
I'm quite sure that these stunningly-beautiful videos are professionally made -- and she probably an energetic actress. In China, with so many millions living miserable city-lives, there is undoubtedly a huge market for viewing an ideal existence -- one the exact opposite of city-life. Maybe she is actually a stunningly beautiful  country-girl caring for her her grandmother and tending multiple gardens of her own, Superwoman-style; I would like to believe that such a scenario is possible of existence. But if it is "just" a professional production, it is practically just as good. Anyway, somebody is doing something remarkably good, and he or she should be congratulated. (There are actually a few things on the Internet worth watching.)
      Toothless Tom
足細っ
めっちゃ羨ましい
Vc vive no paraíso  que felicidade ,quero te conhecer
So I always watch these on my tv and thought I was the only English person... found out I'm not
Harvesting beautiful tomatoes from our old family garden will always be a fond memory of mine. Also, I need that dried tomato bread in my life!
If you are new here, here is absolutely everything you need to know about Liziqi ( Li Ziyi ): 
 
In 1990, Li Ziyi fell to the ground in Mianyang, Sichuan. Her parents divorced when she was very young. Later, her father died, and Li Ziyi became an orphan. His stepmother didn’t treat her well. Li Zizhen mentioned on Weibo that he had had a half-dead experience when his stepmother dragged her hair into the gutter and was beaten.
 
Grandpa and Grandma distressed granddaughter, and finally decided to take Li Ziyu home and live. When Li Ziyi was in fifth grade, his grandfather died again, and it was difficult for his grandma to raise her to continue school. At the age of 14, Li Ziyi had to drop out of school and go to the city alone to work hard, and began an 8-year wandering life. Her first life was very hard. She slept in a park chair and scratched her head for two months.
 
Li Ziyi has also worked as a waiter in a hotel, with a monthly salary of 300 yuan. In order to earn more income, she went to learn to play discs and sang in the bar. Later, when talking about the matter, Li Zizhen frankly said: “I didn’t say that I liked music at that time, just to live, I felt that it was well paid.”
 
In 2012, because grandma was ill once, Li Ziyi was worried that she would regret it later, throwing away all work and returning to grandma. “Being closer, I feel more at ease.”
 
After returning, Li Ziyi opened a Taobao shop, but the business has been up and running, and he barely eats. In 2015, under the influence of his younger brother, Li Ziyi was exposed to the short video platform Meipai. Until 2016, seeing that his younger brother had some fans on Meipai, and holding more fans can improve the mentality of Taobao business, Li Ziyi re-entered Meipai to prepare for his own video program.
 
The reason why she chose to shoot videos in this style is closely related to her childhood environment.
 
In an interview with the living room of Sina Club, Li Ziyi mentioned, “All these things that are self-sufficient in the countryside, for me, they are jealous. In the short video, she chose to start from the most familiar places.
 
In the beginning, Li Ziyi gave himself a topic called “Four Seasons Change, Eat While You Eat”. After the suggestion of Meipai editor, it became “Ancient Food” and it is still used today.
 
In September 2016, a new opportunity came quietly, which also became an important promoter for Li Ziyu to get more attention in the future. Sina Weibo began to openly search for more outstanding short video creators for resource support.
 
As mentioned at the beginning of the article, Liu Tongming brought her Weibo resources support.
 
One day in September 2016, Li Feng, an ancient short video blogger, accidentally received a private Weibo message from “Mr. L”. Mr. L expressed his love for Li Ziyu’s video content, felt that he had fulfilled his Taoyuan dream, and hoped to meet her.
 
For a long time after that, Li Ziyi received Mr. L’s private letter. “It would be a shame for such a good video to let this person see it. This is usChina’s proud traditional culture should be seen by people in China and around the world. “Mr. L said in a private message.
 
At first, after seeing these private messages, Li Ziyi didn’t care too much, even worrying about encountering a liar. Until one day, Mr. L came to the city where Li Zizhen was, and wanted to ask her to have a meal and talk. Mr. L’s politeness and clear logical thinking made Li slowly drop his initial alert.
 
This accidental meeting has completely changed the life trajectory of Li Zizhen. Not long after the meal was over, with the help of Mr. L, Li Zizheng was supported by a large wave of resources on Sina Weibo, accelerating her popularity and allowing Li Zizhen to rush into the queue of the net influencer on the head.
 
This experience is partly recorded in a diary of Li Zizheng that year. Some insiders close to the senior executives of Weinian Technology confirmed to Tencent’s “Shenwang” that the “Mr. L” is actually Liu Tongming, and his pseudonym was publicly reported. Daxiong Liu, the founder of Wei Nian Technology, an MCN company to which Li Zizhen now belongs.
 
On December 8th, the reading volume of a Weibo topic labeled “Is Li Ziyi a cultural output” climbed to 800 million. Li Zizheng was once again on the hot search list.
 
The video created by Li Ziyi and her has become a phenomenon worthy of study now.
 
Extensive overseas communication is an important reason for Li Zihuan’s renewed attention. Some people say that she has filmed a desirable rural life and spread the charm of traditional Chinese culture and cuisine. Others think that her video is not completely true To reflect China’s rural life.
 
Even the queries that have been popular since the explosion have been brought up again, such as being a DJ, being a rich second generation, whether the video is from my own hands, is there a strong push behind it, and the video is true for rural life It’s still just a fiction for character setting.
 
An insider of Weinian Technology told Tencent’s “Deep Web” that Li Ziyi was of ordinary origin, and the relevant video content was produced by Li Ziyi himself. The popularity was not the initiative of the company and himself. In fact, both Li Zihuan and the micro-reading team behind him were quite low-key, and they were very enthusiastic and declined all the current interview needs.
 
Until August 17, 2018, Li Ziyi’s eponymous Tmall store officially opened. Six days after going online, the store with only five products at that time had sales of over 150,000 and sales of over 10 million. A year later, the total sales of 21 products displayed in the Li Zizhen flagship store exceeded 1.3 million, with total sales reaching 71 million.
The value behind Li Ziyi’s IP is being quickly tapped.
 
Li Ziyi started from scratch and gained the first fans with his own strength. But now the popularity and gains of fame and fortune are obviously no longer just her achievements.
According to Tianyan search, “Deep Web” shows that MCN Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co., Ltd., which Li Ziyi belongs to, was established on February 28, 2013, with a registered capital of RMB 5.208 million. According to the introduction, Wei Nian is an entertainment entertainment company that incubates KOL into IP through short videos and extends to consumer brands.
 
The information of Qixinbao shows that there are more than 100 pieces of intellectual property information of the trademark “Li Zihuan”. The applicant companies are Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co., Ltd. The product categories include food, clothing, shoes and hats, dyes and fats, beer and beverages, Financial property management, catering and accommodation.
 
Not only that, Wei Nian also has inextricable links with Li Ziyu’s companies.
 
According to the eye inspection, Li Jiajia (should be the original name of Li Ziyu) established Sichuan Ziyu Culture Communication Co., Ltd. on July 20, 2017, and Wei Nian is its shareholder, holding 51% of the shares. Supervisor, Li Jiajia holds 49% of the shares.
 
According to other data, there are as many as 50 beneficiary companies behind Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co., Ltd., including Greenland Holdings, ZTE, Xinhua Media, Vanke, Light Media, etc. .
Among the shareholders of Weinian Technology, Sina Weibo is particularly eye-catching.
 
From Wei Nian Technology to Sina Weibo, Li Ziyi gradually has the best cards that internet celebrities are looking forward to.
In her own words, she changed from “a little transparent to a person who is so useless to society”. After entering the public view and being noticed by more people, Li Ziyi’s sense of responsibility has also become heavier.
“I want to do what I can to do more things that are good for society, such as the spread of traditional culture, non-heritage cultural craftsmen, and I want to show these old things to everyone so that more people know. Li Ziyi said.

Hope that someday Liziqi will make a video on how to grow her plants so beautifully.

I feel sorry for the one little tomato left behind. Life is cruel, it may think.
