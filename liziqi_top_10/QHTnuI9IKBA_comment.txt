Honestly, sometimes I feel like leaving everything behind and just live there forever, such beauty with no pollutions!
Life should be like this, it's so satisfying to watch such a video like this, the sound of birds singing, the beauty of nature, every thing is just perfect. 
Eu e minha irmã sempre gostamos de assistir os videos desse canal!
Your videos are like anti-depression medicine. God bless you!!!
I'm living in the city so I can't do things like she does (or maybe I will never be able to do it by myself lmao). But atleast her videos make me to push my ass and clean my room and make some stuff by myself (of course it can't be compared with what she does). But more importantly, I finally see how that helps my life so much. I recommend this channel to many people I know and they all love her. To be honest, my life would be the same if I didn't find this channel. Thank you so much Liziqi
I really really appreciate the fact that she didn't go berserk and just picks on every fruit hanging on each and every tree. My mom instilled this habit in us while we were growing up in mountains that to never take more from nature than we need and we used to go back in the mountains to throw away the seeds back so that new plants could grow.
Sou do Brasil! Se soubéssemos valorizar nossa terra como ela ( Liziqi), valoriza! Fico encantada com tudo! É relaxante esses vídeos!
Просто наслаждение смотреть!!! Здоровья и благополучия Вам и Вашей семье!!!
Que sensação de paz que eu sinto ao ver seus vídeos!
Lugar lindo, receitas que dá vontade de sentir o cheiro, a forma de cozinhar, ingredientes naturais e Amor.
The most touching thing is the way she and grandma taking care of each other. Grandma is the reason she is living there and making videos and shared with world. Long lives Grandma!
For anyone thinking that white substance on the dried fruit is mold, its not. Its persimmon sugar that leeches out and crystalizes. Because of the high concentration of that sugar, it helps preserve the fruit better.

I remember my mom getting so mad at me because i would luck off the sugar and leave the actual fruit
Me encantan estos vídeos, sería perfecto si hubiera traducción al castellano, o subtitulos. Muchas gracias!!!!
It feels like I was watching a movie or a documentary, it's so gorgeous
Dear Liziqi, truly you are an awesome girl. I really appreciate your hardworking, your aesthetic sense is commendable. What to mention here, your cultivation methods, cooking style, furniture making, clothes sewing etc.... all are wonderful. Love to see your each post. Hats off! You deserve appreciation. Please pay my best regards to grandma. She is always a helping hand to you even at this age. I bet in her youth she must be the most prettiest girl as even though she is old she is still beautiful. Regards to your all family members. Long live China. Pakistan and China are real brothers.
Amo assistir seus vídeos, me traz paz e me faz lembrar da minha mãe, era bem assim como vc e acho que é sua avó .
this channel brings me peace like ive never felt before. thank you for doing these videos. makes my concrete world consumed by empty people who only have sad faces. chemicals in foods and single file lines. feel less like im here ...and more like im a place that we all should be. a home with nature and family a place and life worth living
its beautiful how it snows on the roses and they still look so alive almost like a fairtytale
This really makes me want to live in the mountains like her and start things from scratch. it will bring so much peace and I would feel connected to nature a lot more and trust me closing your eyes to the sound and feel of nature is amazing! as humans I think we should live like her and enjoy the fresh air sometime and just get away from the world for a while. all these politic battles, wars, technology, work, school, etc. can be super overwhelming especially during times like this. I think it will also serve us well for our health mentally and not only that but the vibes and the breeze of fresh air she breathes and the scenery she wakes up too, as well as the quietness and lonely mornings and nights would feel so nice and refreshing. Learning how to live from making things from scratch and eating fresh fruit and food is a good health and fun thing too! like I want to do that!!
The patience this requires. In such a tech-driven age, where everything comes so quickly, it’s beautiful to watch such a slow process unfold without her getting stressed or annoyed.

Look how long grandma’s peel is!!!! That’s a pro move lol!

Uma sensação de leveza  e paz.
Conexão com a natureza.
Tuve la fortuna de probar esa fruta ya que convivi con una familia china por tres años en Ecuador y ellos la consumian .Cuando era temporada de cosecha en su pais China la exportaban a Ecuador y recuerdo que mi Jefe  aprovechaba y compraba varias cajas para que  asi nos durara mucho . Me encanto,muy muy rica por cierto
My favorite part in this kind of video is harvesting. I love how nature provides the resources.

Yes she’s amazing but can we also give a round of applause to whoever is taking this footage. The angles are insane. We see her from above and below. Great work to all of them,the editing and music is beautiful. Talented people ️
One thing I’ve always been curious about is how she makes such quality videos, I’m wondering if she has a whole production team who helps her,
When I feel disadvantaged from  anything, I come here to feel serenity and calm. She’s adorable, too good to be true but she is indeed very real in her own perfect world.
Esse lugar... ME  transmite uma paz.. MARAVILHOSO..
Каждый день смотрю видео этой замечательной девушки. Для меня это и отдых и событие! Я даже хотела бы уехать и жить такой же жизнью...
Gracias por las traducciones en español en los temas... Agradezco mucho y en algunos vídeos
Good fruit, good content, beautiful sister ️
I really want a garden with fruit and vegetables like hers
I have been a chef almost 20 years, im glads i found this chanel, watching all videos that you've made bring a lot of peaceful mind, everything is well thought out, the lifestyle the food and the passion behind all. Great work and keep it up! Very appreciated.
This ladie is amazing  and so inspireing could watch her every day.
Love from IRELAND.
I just realized..this is the 1st video of liziqi that I had watched,and I subscribed imidiately..last year..I really liked her videos,so relaxing and amazing at the same time..
Me encatan tus videos .. me acuerdo que los empesé a ver cuando estaba embarazada , uff que paz y tranquilidad me generan . Muchas gracias y mucho éxito
Persimos o caqui, son una verdadera delicia, en mi país no hay, soy Ángeles Patlan y soy mexicana, excelente lo k haces, te admiro, un fuerte abrazo de México para China.
The persimmon that just fell apart when she pulled it off the branch looked so good ;-; I haven't had super tree ripened persimmons in ages ;-; mannnnnnnnnn her video always look so good
I have developed a habit of watching her videos before going to bed it like a relaxation therapy 
Я очень люблю этот фрукт.
Я просто поражена что ее можно сушить и получить такой вкусный сухо фрукт , да ещё с чаем .
Просто супер!
Feel the real tranquility while watching all of her  lovely serene  videos   lots of love to u & your granny Liziqi .. I'm from Pakistan 🇵🇰
This is what i love..always nature, self made and always good ideas..really love to watch 
After watching this channel I actually bought a case of dried persimmons. They are amazing!
They look very delicious ! Great video 
She should win Nobel Peace Prize for bringing true peace to everyone.
I always feel happy to watch Linziqi's videos
The sounds of the sorroundings reminds how peaceful to live in a countryside.

I'm from China and I watch this incidentally while studying abroad. I can't stop watching her aesthetic videos. It makes my mind flying back home and back to my childhood. I really miss the delicious food and especially the beautiful rural scenery.
I've been feeling so excited about watching this video. How could life in the countryside be such attractive!
Everything feels so artistic. From the beautiful location, camera positions, the lovely music and the editing.  It all comes together quite beautifully.
Gw berasa menyatu banget dgn alam desa ini..Kangen suasana spt ini
Представляю какая вкуснятина, стоит только мечтать, чтобы попробовать....
I loved the natural sceneries of your videos 
Ты-эталон, совершенство ты - прекрасна
This was perfection! One of the most satisfying videos I've seen so far!
She's being so productive and I can't even get up and clean my room
Восхищаюсь умением всё делать и трудалюбием вашим !!!.Жаль что не перевода на русский язык
Lucky i found this channel. Nature beauty and her simplicity / hardwork
Так нравится эта девушка, Лизи!А какое шикарное место,где она живёт!
I'm so grateful for these videos. They are so beautiful and so well made, I feel like I'm watching a Nat geo documentary. Thank you so much for these videos, I cannot get enough
Você é incrível
I probably sound exactly like a million other people when I say this, but I LOVE your channel! Your talents are exquisite and your videos fill me with peace. This is a harsh, angry world we live in, but your art helps remind me that life is still beautiful. THANK YOU.
Thiz is something that we need in our life !purity nature and simplicity ...love this life 
do Brasil, saudades dos videos de  LI ZI QI
Esses vídeos me acalmam
I love your videos they are very relaxing. The music in the background is beautiful.
Vc é uma garotinha muitooooo esperta e inteligenteeeee amo vc️
Every grandmother in the world can peal a fruit in one long piece.
I've seen this type of preserved persimmon in a Korean movie called Little Forest. Highly recommended that movie for those who love watching food making from scratch. That movie has this Liziqi feel too. So far I'm not yet a big fan of persimmons but would definitely give it a try someday. As soon as I got the chance to go to places where it is grown  ;)
I just discovered your channel and I'm already obsessed, thank you so much for sharing your culture with us in such a creative and artistic way, your videos are perfect in every way possible, and to make it even better it has english subtitles for us, international viewers to understand. Thank you so much for your hard work, keep it up, please :)
Beautiful mountains, Beautiful Weather, Beautiful Village
Love you  from NORTH-EAST India🇮🇳 (Tripura)
Who so ever shoots her video,   does the editing is a good professional.  She has a good team to showcase her concept .
Linda trabalhadora!   Amei
thank you for giving me an inspiration.. your videos mean a lot to me and  i alsolove your grandmother’s laugh same smile of my grandmother, who is in heaven right now..
Another beautifully filmed video; each season brings something special. Natural living. :)
Whenever I am tired of this stressful modern world. Your channel is one of the place I come for mental healing. Your videos are therapy for healing. So peaceful :). Congrats on 1 million subscribers.
Beautiful story..now I know what to do next fall when I see those boxes of gorgeous persimmons. Thank you!
Must be truly amazing, to wake up in such a special place... Its so beautiful, spiritually awakening. Being able to wake up with peacefulness of nature and that a place exists so natural  that  it almost doesn't seem real. More like picture perfect..
I just realized tht i’ve watched all her videos already but i keep watching them over anf over again cus i found peace and serenity
Love from pakistan...I have already referred many people this channel...so surreal and absolutely a treat to watch ...this lady has amazing cooking skills ...her sheer hard work makes me feel we all need to work harder for healthier diets in r homes
This is another incredibly good, brilliant, beautiful, and INSPIRING video from Ms. Liziqi (who is also beautiful, hardworking, and brilliant.).  We over here in Los Angeles, love your videos so much.  The videos are also very therapeutic, soothing, and relaxing.  Thank you so much for sharing all your videos, and for all your hard work. 
Normal people: listen to asmr to sleep
Me: watches this pretty lady living in a pretty paradise make everything under the sun
Your videos are so 'human' and natural. What a wonderful break from all the madness.....
Watching after a year again...your vlogs are Beautiful to see and that Nature arround you is Too beautiful
Смотрю с большим удовольствием! Хотела бы тоже там жить...
I love to watch her videos  cz I love the area where she live in the lap of nature ️️I wish I could also live in such surroundings️️
I just  love your videos !! You are so amazing 
She deserves  Nobel peace prize for  her hardworking her beauty her maturity her natural spirit with all my respect from Morocco I wish go to these mountains one day
It is really very interesting to know the way of life and work of other people in the world, I love your channel
My favourite fruit! I ate bags of this on my first visit to China. What an incredible country and people. This is the China I love
Persimmons are one of my favorite fruit but they are not native to my city and the weather here makes it practically immposible to harvest them locally. Every year they appear in the markets for a week or two at frankly ridiculous prices so I can only buy one or two.
Seeing them grow free in the mountains, hanging there until they're picked, makes me realize how different my home is from Li's home. But I am not sad, I am happy that the world is different everywhere because it makes me wish to travel and see all those beautiful places myself.
I may love persimmons, but whenever I see the vineyards near my house, I know that I too have something unique to cherish.
Thank you for all the relaxing awesome videos.  I read your story and it is truly inspirational.  Keep doing this and stay true to yourself and stay safe. Your older brother from America.
I appreciate all teams which do lots of hardwark  and reach these channel till Million subscribers. Because of these hardwark we love the channel 
when i'm watching your videos i feel relaxing .. and thanks YouTube for the translation to English . watching from Iraq 🇮🇶
Your world is soo beautiful  ,  I wish I could live there too
The reason we find this peaceful and Zen like is because this is how we were meant to live.
Your vídeos inspire me a lot and give me peace. Thank you, from the bottom of my heart.
I love persimmons and you made them more 
Me encantan tus videos
Как Божественно!!!!!
I adore this, but I have a question for anyone who is familiar with growing and air drying fruit- does this not attract bugs and flies? I've always lived in places where the slightest sweet thing left outside would attract a zillion ants
Some info about Li Ziqi: Li Ziqi's grandfather was a cook in her village, many of her cooking and woodwork skills were learned from her grandfather. In the initial stage, she did everything alone by herself because she could not affort hiring people. After she became famous she hired an assistant and a videographer to help her.
Really love watching your videos liziqi
Wow! That’s amazing! I want to try it 
I am inspired by Liziqi,and also I have started to do work all time.Thankyou Liziqi
Eu sou no Brasil e amo assistir seus vídeos.  Liziqi, obrigada por tão excelente conteúdo!
Ben bu kadının videolarını izlerken huzur buluyorum be ♡︎♡
Her grandmother is so cute .. I'm glad we got to see her up close!️
very beautiful and fertile village.  and I would be very comfortable if I lived in a village like that.
This is just one of the best YouTube channels there is, I absolutely love it! It doesn't even matter about the translation to English, it's brilliant, so relaxing. Thank you for sharing a bit of your life with us. X
Que bonito video que compartió hace 3 años que frutas son bendiciones aquí en mi país no hay.
This is really amazing lifestyle , Nd u r really a great person... from 🇧🇩
She has so much energy. How does she do it? She is a very beautiful woman and human being inside and out. I can't say enough about her inner and outer beauty. Bless her heart and all women like her.
I always wondered what persimmons taste like - I see them now and then in the autumn but I've never tried one
Tudo maravilhoso
I always watch Liziqi's videos while studying.
These videos totally resfreshes my mind.
I realy love her️
Love form India️

Quanta sabedoria ha nesta moça. Parabéns Liziqi

Thank you for the English subtitles. MUCH appreciated.
The persimmon area tho, it's so aesthetically satisfying to see it.
She is an angel, lives in heaven and I heard she has a very good heart, cares for nature, animals and poor people, she donated her hard earned money for the needy..SHE IS IN FACT GODS OWN CHILD.  LOVE and respect  YOU LIZIQI FROM INDIA.

Your garden, your knowledge with cooking and everything else makes your content remarkably amazing. Thank you so much! Take your time posting videos, we will be here always to support you! :)
Addicted to watch these all videos...really great job.
Her channel makes me remind how I used to live in the deep countryside in Japan with my grandma... I miss her and back that day so much!
Просто чудо.
I'm about to harvest my persimmons and attempt to dry them the first time. Thanks for you instruction. I love your ending, what a treat for the cold winder days.
Love your videos, absolutely awesome
I am very grateful to you, a friend, for the beautiful and wonderful videos presented to us. I support you every time. I wish you success and success.
I love your videos! ️
Thank you for your recipe. You know, in my country (France) there's plenty of those fruits, we call them "KAKI". But they rot on trees each year, 'cause people no longer eat them. Your channel enchants me by beauty of the videos, the serenity that comes out from them, the effort that makes sense, or gives meaning to life. God bless you and your people my dear.
Pengen punya rumah ada halaman luas segala ada tanaman sayuran dan buah, dan pengen peralatan masak kaya ituu

I'd gladly trade my current life for this.
Liziqi .I love how this channel brings people together from so many different cultures and languages! Liziqi is my inspiration. I live in Malaysia.
The people disliking this video don’t understand how life can be so peaceful so they dislike when others are feeling something, what they don’t understand yet.
Как сказку смотрю вас ребята. Спасибо большое пребольшое за удовольствие и прекрасную съёмку!!
Idk from where m i getting this recommendations but it's really great I have never been to such place but I still feel it... Love to that grandma for making her this much talented

One of my favorite fruits, a while tree!
I like this video and made me wanted to watch all your other videos. Wonderful is not enough to descripe it.
Grandma peeling that persimmon in one long stroke, that's how you know she's a pro!
本来の中国は広大で豊かな自然環境があって、昔ながらの生活そのままに。それを肌で感じさせてくれる素晴らしい動画だと思います。
yo he comido esta fruta y esta riquísima era la fruta favorita de mi padre . los persimonios    ..
How does she manage to do her work in nature and obtain such a quality video production? Of course nature is beautiful! All over our world. This actress is magnificent but she is simply an actress ... It's life is only possible outside the camera ... Because these two worlds never mix when they really want stay pure.
First  time watch this channel.....Really Mind Blowing video...your garden is amazing
Thanking you for the beautiful nature based content. Just to say, in my newly released book, Re-imagining mathematics,  by Ashna Sen, I explore how the whole of mathematics can emerge from nature,  the arts and even community...exactly what you do!
When i watching your video am feeling life style.
I love how every single part of the ingredient is used and not wasted.
I love watching your videos. It feels me relax and Contented in Life.
Hermosos lugares
Jb  this lady is a genius. Love all her videos. From UK. Thank you so much
Liziqi's video is healing ️️️
The natural living is so healthy.  Besides her beaity, look how beautiful her skin is.   I love watching her videos.
Que admirable eres...
I have a feeling the persimmon tree's are alive and they are always happy when you come along to visit them :)
So relaxing 
This place is so beautiful..love this channel
I have tried this method & enjoyed very much . The persimmon tastes really gud but it takes enough time
Çok büyük bir hayranlıkla izliyorum sizi muhteşemsiniz
MaşaAllah burası bir cennet ️
She use to be a DJ but she decided back to hometown living with her grandmother since her grandmother got a serious sick .So Amazing!!!
Really loved to watch ur each n every video ️ lots of love from Nepal️️️
Liziqi... Eres la mejor.
Eu não sei falar sua língua mais acho vc uma mulher admirável
This is all about patience, hard work, focus and a nice background music.
I’ve always admired u ever since I found this channel a long time ago, I really wanna live and experience what u have bc your life seems so peaceful
I used make dried persimmons in Japan. We call them hoshi-gaki (干し柿) there. They are made with the kind of persimmons called Shibu-gaki (渋柿) which not for eating raw like she did here.  I love them both fresh/ripe Kaki (柿) and dried one.  Dried ones are unbelievably sweet and rich.  Thank you for the beautiful video!  This stirs up the happy memories and nostalgia for me.
It is so relaxing watching your videos
I just wanted to stay in your house so beautiful there's so many fruits and veggies,what a nice and wondrous place
Me fascina este video,... Adoro los caquis... No dejo de ver este vídeo una y otra y otra y otra vez
Ahhhhhhh I’m SOOOOO jealous 
Persimmon is my favourite fruit but here in Canada they are so expensive in most grocery stores and not always there 
I want those persimmon trees
Too bad we can not up vote each time we watch it again!  This is one of my favorites of hers, not sure why...I have never tried a persimmon...
In fact, we all know the countryside life is poor and mostly miserable. That’s why most countryside people moved to the fascinating city where life is , where life is more easier and more entertainment.  But Ziqi‘s Videos showed us the countryside life can be elegant and beautiful.  I was also born in the countryside and have a few years raised there.  After knowing her childhood life, I found that the power of Ziqi‘s life is that She made a beautiful rainbow out of her miserable childhood. She never complains, she is the true artist and philosophy of the real life. She deserves Respect.
Absolutely magnificently filmed. 
i absolutely love your channel. please please please add subtitles to your videos. continue to live the dream. thank you for your hard work!
My daughter had a persimmon tree in her yard. I wish I had known about Li Ziqi's technique about drying and storing persimmons. We could have saved so much more! They are naturally sweet and I love the use of the skins between each layer, again nothing goes to waste!
2:44 it looked so beautiful! Just like holiday lights!

If I went picking persimons I would have none left by the time I got home; delicious
That single snow covered red rose was stunningly beautiful 
Супер, пойти нарвать хурмы в лесу, МЕЧТА
so everyone accept the truth, ziqi basically have every type of food in her village
Liziqi. Im your big fan. You are my inspiration. From India
My family makes cookies from persimmons every Christmas and I love them. This video brings me back to those times. Also Greetings from Alaska
Muy lindo.. parece ser el cielo.
I want to live peacefully like her..
I feel hungry and want to add sweetness to the fruit.
I've had persimmons once and omg what I give to find them again.
Its almost fall here in oregon. with all the people who dont like persimmons around here im super excited to try this!!
Those hands of her shows dedication and passion, her craft is amazing she put her heart in it. She's not an actress or whatsoever, she just wanted to show us what we're missing in life, God bless you liziqi and your grand mom
Привет из Украины))) Прекрасный канал. ничего подобного раньше не видела) Вы неземная)))
Who else is here to watch something beautiful and relaxing during the pandemic 
This video was legitimately amazing.
Liziqi, I envy your life living in a piece of heaven...nice, peaceful and near in nature.
I am 32 years old and I from  the countryside. When I was a child , our family had a big persimmon garden. Every year, my parents would make many persimmons. Now, when we hear Koreans say that dried persimmon is their culture, I am really surprised. Koreans often say that China steals their culture, which is ridiculous. China has a vast land and abundant resources. We don't export much culture to the outside world, so many foreigners don't know much about Chinese culture. The important thing is that  Chinese are not keen on the world heritage. NOW Many people still don’t know that in many cultural exchange activities between China and South Korea , after the cultural exchange activities ended, Koreans immediately took Chinese culture as their own culture and apply for heritage.
Love your videos , Liziqi.
they look so delicious, wanna try this in China next year.
Really no words describe this beauty..Like a piece of heaven..Thank you
Masanobu Fukuoka would be proud of Ziqi. Thank you for another lesson of simple and great life.
Persimmon is local Chinese fruit that we're later introduced to other east Asian countries.
Video quality content is Awesome 
your place makes my eyes 
fruits and veges just around the house, I really love it     
Лизи твоя бабуля проживет пусть долго в твоих руках
This reminds me so much of me and my grandma where she lived in Gangnam country side in korea!! It looked similar but more houses near  but since me and my grandma live next to a mountain we would go up and pick fruits! We would go visit other grandmas house and sell them fruits and eat and talk with them but sadly my grandpa died and I had to leave korea to go to Australia because my cousin is getting married and she wanted to go to Australia for her wedding. So grandma was alone and she got stressed bad I came back and heard she fainted and went to hospital.
柿饼原来是这么制作出来的。影片，制作的非常精美。唯美的意境令人叹服。
Who films all of your videos.so relaxing.  You work so hard everyday.
Land to live everything is always here️
I am crying from this beauty ...normal natural ...
看到漫遍野的柿樹  滿樹滿枝  掛著金灿灿 紅彤彤的柿子  真的賞心悅目 也配服前人的智慧  經過幾道繁瑣的工序  予時间耐心
將柿子制成乾品 供沒有柿子收成的日子享用
The life in eternal sunny beach (in the city where I live) is good, but the lifestyle of Liziqi in lush natural mountain is much better. Historically ancient people usually liked (or didn't have option but) to live surrounded by conflict and war, although when they get tired of it and laid down arms or drop their worldly and problematic milieu they frequented, then they go to retire and meditate close to nature : in the shore of a lake, a temple in the mountain among forests or simply in a garden, they get the calm they needed to cope with their troubled or tormented past lifes.
很开心看到中国的文化走到了世界的舞台上，并且受到这么多人喜欢！
We have to pay so much money for persimmons in Canada and there she was picking them free from the mountains 
I am so glad I found your channel, watching your videos brings back a lot of great memories of my late first wife, she was Chinese and she had a beautiful heart, I do miss here greatly even though she's been gone for over 30 years now...
I tried this fruit for the first time last yr it is so good.
I want to live like this️
First time I tried this, I was like, wow, this is so good
AMAZING, thanks for sharing the beauty of your Country!!!
Quiero ir a china eres mi favorita
她家鄉的柿子豐收，於是她收購了一公噸的柿子，送给二百個粉絲，每人五公斤，既幫助了家鄉的老人也令到粉絲得益，全都是她出的錢，多好的人啊！
Li Zi Qi's hometown persimmon harvest, she bought a metric ton of persimmon, gave her 200 fans, 5 kg per person, so that the elderly in her hometown and her fans both benefit, pay is her own money,  What a nice person!
Сколько в лесу вкусноты,на всю зиму будет хурма,как сушит и вялит ее,умница,а какая она у них урожайная,питаясь одними витаминами,а не залежалыми и не вызревшими да ещё обработаннымиядохимикатами,будешь всегда здоров!как я ей завидую!! А что мы едим?лучше об этом помолчать!счастливая работящая пчелка
That place where she liuved is so peacefully and so much nature
Greetings from Mexico, from a city called Monterrey, also called the city of the mountains
Amazing  place  of  her. . Shes  very  loving  to  her  granny. . Talented  beautiful  n  loving  liziqi
Fantastic! So many wise things and perfection. 
I envy being in a place and community that allows this traditional work.
Beautiful and great food 100% hard work  for Grandma
看李子柒的视频眼泪在眼睛里打转，瓢泼在外的人真的好想家，想父母，想中国的各种吃的。
que hermoso.
Love a fresh mountain feels relaxing
Aku sangat senang nonton video ini,sungguh menginspirasi banget.
1:14 - That scene looks so magical to me. Her blue shirt and the orange persimmons harmonize so well together.
I want to visit your house once ..I found the actual peace there
Rather than live in bustling cities, this is the kind of life I would like to live️

Its simple. And you more connect to nature️
I really want to live with her after watching her videos T^T
I love how capable you are. You never expect anyone to help, but you accept it from those who wish to do so. Also, I would have just assumed the white coating was mold. Goodness, how wrong I have been about so many things. Creation is magnificent. Your way of life helps me understand this more than I had previously. I feel like I've said this before, though, I feel like that's just deja vu.
Patience and hard work....️ inspiration women
I wish my persimmon tree would hurry up and have fruits so i can eat persimmons fresh and dry
We can feel the pure nature here
I'm from Africa and I enjoy your food and lifestyle so much, your home is beautiful and an inspiration to us because you are so hardworking and committed, I subscribe and look forward to seeing more new content, thank you and keep up the great work
Apa cuman saya yg berasal dari Indonesia suka nonton chanel ini? Nenangin banget liatnya 
That little sound she makes when she is eating something and feels pleased with the taste
Hope you and your granny is doing good love watching
I want live in mountain are and have life like this. 
Wow, what a peaceful place to live in... 
I'm kinda jealous 
Great editing! These videos are beautifully done.
Where is this magical place where every fruit and vegetables grow wildly ..I must live in this paradise ..my DREAM ️
The life I longed for was to live in peace like that for the rest of my life
I think it should be delicious 
🇧🇷️
This is so beautiful!
Translation for her poetic Mandarin meanings :

Witnessing again the hills in red,
Small little fruits have spread their colour across the fall season,
Plucking a basket of persimmons,
With their skins peeled off and air-dried,
Tasty little dried persimmons are again ready for this year.
Even though I hate persimmons she made them look so delicious!
This video made me cry...and think of my own grandmother in China. I grew up in a small village and my grandmother still lives in a similar, humble home as the one in this video. I am going back to China this summer and I am looking forward to doing simple things and helping the family farm. Thank you for this video. ️
Ước gì nhà mình có cây hồng chỉ nhìn thôi là đủ rồi.

I have not seen a persimmon grow before! Super!
This is stunning. Please watch healthy and quick recipes.
This galaxy will always be our home ️
How i wish i can live here...such a heaven 
Bình yên quá!! Iu chị 
Hello from France 🇫🇷 !! I love the quite atmosphere in your videos. They bring peace and wisdom !! A real pleasure to watch all the colors of nature all around you.
So nice. I love it️️️️️
This place looks like a paradise. Everything is in so much abundance here. I live in atlanta, USA. I planted a persimmon tree. Every years it bears lots of fruits but most of them fell down and in the end only 3 or 4 are left.
Me facina tu modelo de cocinar la musica , yal respecto todo lo q se aprende atravez de aprovechar todo lo q te rodea me resulta maravillozo sabiduria y se agradece cariños y es grandioso el arte q nos permite deleitar me fascina
Thật xinh đẹp mà lại giỏi nấu ăn nữa trong khi còn chưa dậy thì , sau này ai may mắn lấy được em ấy thì sẽ đảm bảo được sức khẻo
She only take the amount of things she want in a limited way from the nature _       that's amazing 
Oh my, so many persimmons! I like the way they are strung up to dry.  Luckily there are no greedy magpies to help themselves!
I always come back to see the sweet comments about you Li Ziqi️
She's so careful and precise with everything she makes or does.
I am so in love with this place,that too at first sight
Owww how sweet... what a wonderful collection... lots of love from Bangladesh.
Its amazing nd inspired me aloooor.. am big fan of u sister.. I really like ur admiration
Even the seasons are much on her favour. I never noticed any pesky insects that would hinder her daily grinds of life.
I love your videos!
I wish I can be there. I finally found a channel that is calming  me at the same time  informative.
I wonder....














Why are her videos so inspiring

Does anyone know how she is able to leave food in the open to dry without bugs eating it?
All gmas can get that perfect peel. All 1 continuous peel and thin.  
好美啊！ 李子柒帶我們回到伊甸園了嗎？！️️️
Im 36yrs old thank you for all the videos you upload I live alone I learn a lot from you pls don't stop I need to learn more to survive alone
I want to go there it's so peaceful and full of fruits and vegetables
Tôi yêu cái thôn yên tĩnh một mình!!!

Not a single thing will be wasted ...
Love this ️
She is amazing... a totally talented
I am a strange fruit eater, I am not satisfied with some of them at all
That snow in your country is so gorgeous ️️️
What a Beautiful life 
Que hermoso lugar! Clima espectacular y las frutas silvestres simplemente divino. El paraíso existe  y está aquí en la tierra...
What a wonderful video
Девушка просто красавица и умница. Она меня вернула в детство ! Я тоже выросла в деревне возле леса в Красивой ..., зеленной, и цветущей Молдове.   Ах как хочется вернуться из америке домой и поехать жить в деревню. Я эту школу прошла, так что мне ничего не чуждо!. Правда у нас немного иная кухня  но, соленья ,  и сбор урожая похоже.Практика есть   как пройти весь процесс. За то все натуральное без химии!. Благодарность и большой плюс за благородный и нелегкий труд девушке с золотыми ручками и энтузиазм!
When I watching these videos, I feel I am in a dream..

God bless you my little cute girl
I live in an apartment and miss nature so much. She lives in paradise. Beautiful
Whenever I seen it I feel peace ️
Just love love her life and everything that’s around her. So calming and earthy. Dream life
I really like the way she live her life.
The birds chirping is healing to me.  Thanks for sharing.   Im blessed
المزرعة رائعة جدا مثل الجنه وفتاة المزرعة قمه في الجمال والنشاط وعملها راااايع جدا
This is so beautiful  I love your life 
Me encantan los caquis y los mancaquis ...aquí en invierno ...son dulces ,suaves,,cristalinos....mmmmm delicias
This was the most beautiful and serene thing I've seen in my life. Excellent work!
Сказка. Красота.
I’ve been to the sichuanese countryside and mountainous regions, where my family is from. The scenery is truly breathtakingly beautiful, but life is unbelievably hard: dirt roads after heavy rain, power outages in the summer, damp cold and dark winters, very poor infrastructure, old cold houses without much insulation or a heating system, brutally hot summers, etc etc. Let’s appreciate the beauty of the traditional way of life but let’s not romanticize away the hard work she and other farmers put into their work <3
Где же это снято? Это так здорово!!!
Ne kadar güzel ya keşke orda olsam
李子柒的視頻，包括她本人可能沒想到，她這視頻會啟發人性，覺醒人心，改變現行，
Очень трудолюбивая девушка , а самое главное все натуральное , которого нам сейчас не хватает и заметьте все делает сама, очень редкое в наше время любовь к пожилому человеку. Счастья ей здоровья , любви и удачи .
The Great Wall of China, Confucius, and Chi Pao are historically Korean cultures. Confucius was born in Gyeongju, Korea, and had parents of Korean descent, and the Great Wall was built by Koreans to protect the Korean Peninsula from enemies. Chipao is also a modified dress from Hanbok. Koreans wore hanbok when they wanted to be formal, and chifao when they slept or were not formal. Currently, we can see minorities in China wearing a chifao, which is to borrow Korean culture a long time ago and maintain it to the present.
I live in New York City in the U.S. and work for the Asia Cultural Foundation. New Yorkers know all of the above, and our Asian Cultural Foundation judges the roots of Chinese history as Korea.
You can learn more about this story if you visit Korea and New York. :)
thank you.

万里长城、孔子、旗袍在历史上都是韩国的文化。 孔子出生在韩国的庆州，有韩国血统的父母，万里长城是韩国人为保护韩半岛免遭敌人袭击而建造的。 旗袍也是韩服中变形的衣服。 韩国人想打扮的时候穿韩服，睡觉的时候没有格调的场合穿旗袍。 现在可以看到中国的少数民族穿旗袍，那是借着很久之前的韩国文化维持至今的。
我现在在美国纽约市生活，在亚洲文化财团工作。 纽约市民都知道以上内容，我们亚洲文化财团的人判断中国历史的根源是韩国。
如果访问韩国全国和纽约，就能更详细地了解这个故事。 :)
thank you.

我在使用翻译器。


만리장성과 공자, 치파오는 역사적으로 한국의 문화입니다. 공자는 한국의 '경주'라는 곳에서 태어나 한국 혈통의 부모를 두었고, 만리장성은 한국인들이 적으로부터 한반도를 보호하기 위해 지은 것입니다. 치파오 역시 한복에서 변형된 옷입니다. 한국인들은 격식을 차리고 싶을 때는 한복을 입고, 잠을 잘때나 격식없는 자리에서는 치파오를 입었습니다. 현재 중국의 소수민족이 치파오를 입는 것을 볼 수 있는데, 그것은 아주 오래전 한국의 문화를 빌려 현재까지 유지하는 것입니다. 
저는 지금 미국 뉴욕시에서 살고 있고 아시아 문화재단에서 일합니다. 뉴욕 시민들은 위 내용들을 모두 알고 있으며, 우리 아시아 문화재단 사람들은 중국 역사의 뿌리를 한국으로 판단하고 있습니다. 
이 이야기는 한국 전국과 뉴욕에 방문하면 더 자세히 알 수 있습니다. :)
It was honestly beautiful to watch you cut permissions with your grandma. Love your videoss
Literally dying to visit there
So beautiful nature yar loved it
Watching this again this year..actually i've watched all of ur videos..and sometimes im watching ur old videos...
Hum, that was easy. Glad I watched, I have persimmons on a tree now. Yes, a beautiful video.
Amo vê tudo isso , mim faz tão bem ,
I have two persimmon trees in my back yard. This year the trees bore so much fruits and I sent them to my friends all over USA. I think I know what to do with them next seasons. Thank you for sharing.
Saya suka sekali nonton video mu kak Liziqi 
جميل ️

Your video always makes me so hungry 
No sé si me entiendan , pero me topé con este canal y no he dejado de verlo, está hermoso su país, la veo desde México

A lovely look at persimmon dried jewels
Keren banget nech kameraman sama editor nya mantap dah
Huaa kenapa gw baru tau ada konten beginian adem banget ngeliatnya
I had a persimmon for the first time today, and I'm 24. It turns out I was eating it wrong as I ate it with the skin on. It was kind of youtube to re-recommend this video, so I'll peel it next time.
La cosas mas bonitas es el Planeta Thera  i tu le das el valor que lo merece. Felicidades!!!
Liziqi .I love how this channel brings people together from so many different cultures and languages! Liziqi is my inspiration. I live in Vietnam
看见了岁月的流逝，
看见了传统的气息，
更看见了静的美丽。
She is my model hero. I also want to be like her! Hope one day...
Do these grow wild, or do you cultivate them
我非常佩服她，如果我有這樣的妻子，我會非常愛她，但是我是越南人，她擅長做很多事情，包括男人的工作
So nice fruits  and soo soo beautiful sister   
I am a 3rd generation Chinese from my maternal side and a second generation Chinese from paternal side. And although my parents are still deeply rooted to their relations in China and visit her regularly, I have a somehow biased view of China , especially the rural after growing up only knowing English. My impression of rural China is certainly upped x100 after seeing your videos..Thanks so much for showing me the beauty of China and I plan to visit my roots soon.. Love, Malaysia...
太好看了！原来我从小吃到大的柿饼是这样做成的。
I wish if I have a village life and be a girl like you..!! Your videos are like a meditation. Thanks a lot beautiful! Greetings from Sri Lanka! 
I am so entranced by all her videos!!

李子柒绝对是个项目管理大师，这么多这么长周期的视频同步进行，还质量这么好。
I'm from India and big fan of you...... Really your videos such as a amazing........
我的家鄉滿山都是柿子 ，記得小時候爺爺、奶奶、爸爸、媽媽、叔叔們全家動員一起摘柿子做成柿餅，葉子做成茶葉，皮曬乾稱“柿花”泡水喝下火，採摘過程掉地破掉的做成柿片稱“柿錢”，完整的做成柿餅，有用鹽水泡的稱“鹽味柿”，石灰泡的柿子稱“石灰柿” ，真的非常感謝子柒視頻讓我此刻滿滿的兒時回憶，爺爺奶奶你們在天堂過的好嗎？
Karena memasuki musim dingin dan salju makanya orang di china, bercocok tanamnya ngebut buat stok makanan, makanya pada berkerja keras️
Granny is so adorable! 
My name is Güven.I am Kurds.Sizi Türkiye'den izliyorum.Harikasınız.Doğanız çok güzel.Domuz eti hariç diğer yiyecekleriniz güzel.
一直很好奇柿饼怎么做的 能够以这么美的方式了解的真的太棒了
We make these in Azerbaijan as well, exactly the same, how odd!
When I was a child, I did this with my grandparents, but in that time I extremely hated doing that. But after I became a grown-up and live in the city, I miss these days so much!
What a beautiful video 
So beautiful 
李子柒太好了，滿山紅滿山都是水果和花，好漂亮好美呀
Des images magnifique du Sichuan, une belle ambiance! Xiexie  ni  LI ZIQI
Man where does she live at? Is beautiful i would not mind living in such a beautiful place like this. Looks so peaceful and hidden.
I'm supposed to watch something related about my career but  i couldn't stop myself  from watching her videos continuously. I got so addicted 
Everything is beautiful!
She’s so hard working lady ️I strongly appreciate her working 
Persimmons are one of my favorite fruits, but are rare to find in Northern Maine (stores just don't carry them). I'm so envious of your Persimmon trees.
Beautiful ️ place 
she brings me so much inner peace
I want to be like her 
Привет из России!Ты умница!
In our country we make such  snacks too, only we dry different berries like strawberry, raspberry, currant, cherry. We call them ''qaq''
This type of vedio make me feel so good and fresh
So amazing 
It's really cool, very beautiful
I am big fan of your work and you all have been trying your best.I am from the bangladesh..love you..
Tui rất thích xem những video giống vậy cảm ơn bạn
only your channel can make all kinds people of the world feel peace!!!
You are a fairy ️️️
These videos are very beautiful.
I love persimmon ️️️
Li ziqi lives in nature, but most of us live in the buildings and look forward to nature.
You are really a treasure.No one, woman in my place, make this work.For them happy is whatever keep them away from farm working.If a man says to a woman,l am a farmer, they go away, with light speed
Here is the translation: The mountains are covered in redness again. In the fall I naturally want to make some hanging persimmons to preserve it's sweetness. 
Yet again I see redness in the mountains, each little fruit fill the fall. Carrying a back basket full of persimmons, peel off the skin, dry them. This year have yummy hanging persimmons again. (not 100% perfect but hope this translation helps some of you guys)
No doubt she lives in a fairytale world, full of peace and nature.
Thank u so much for sharing...the fruit looks so delicate...my mother use to make persimmon yum! Bless u and ur family...and again, thank u for sharing ur world with us...I live on the Atlantic coast in South Carolina...I see ur dear family...my father is 94 and we have him with us...family is everything...

Guaaaaa asi me caso q mujer mas bella en sentido de todo es fantastica 
我分享給國外的朋友看，她的第一反應就是有一個很厲害的團隊，太商業，我其實是想她看看子柒，她的生活態度，結果可想而知，移民國外後，國內不論是什麼，總是戴有色眼睛看，所以真是志不同呀！
So beautiful beyond words and see she is so hardworking. Can anyone tell me where is this
好美的柿餅

Am from india but I love this country
Translated to English : It’s a red mountain, and in the autumn, I’m going to do some sweetness.
See also the mountain,
A small fruit dyed all over the autumn.
Pick a persimmon,
Peeling
Delicious dried persimmons have another year~
Wow.Those delicious peaches.
I love dried fruits - those seems to be very sweet - when they are dried, the fruitsugar cames out and lay on the outside skin , just like plums - i really want to taste those...
Absolutely beautiful video
I love this fruits. It's very tasty but very expensive in kuwait. അടിപൊളി ആണ്.
Caquis les llamamos persimonios. Deben estar maduros para comerlos.
Love from India

莫名地喜欢叶子飘落大地的那一幕，“一叶知秋”，老祖宗的智慧，也许只是平常之物，而这一幕存在于秋实的色彩和初寒之间，却是平添了几分新意~~

还有那落雪️️️，突然好想去看一场雪呢～～落雪的清晨是否是寂静无声呢？应该会很美吧～～️️️
wow beautiful place nature is most beautiful just like heaven
Manifique décorations
Even though the video has been upload 2 years ago, but when I have insomnia I will watch it again and again until I fall asleep.

The way she hang the persimmons look like a curtain to me. I want a curtain made of persimmons. When im hungry I’ll just pick and eat.
Deep down,I know this is what life is meant to be.....
They are so many languages in the comment section.  She's getting known to the world little by little everyday.  She should be the honorary ambassador of China lol.   Congrats on reaching 1 million subscribers!
For a brief moment at the start i was wondering ‘why don’t you pluck it off the branch instead of cutting the whole twig?’ Then she did and the pit came out and I went ‘Oh....that’s why...my bad....’ lololol
健康的食物~什么都会做~好棒
Beautiful nature ️️️️️️.

Amazing. 
Less dialog but i can understand the main story through your video. The video shot and the backsong, describe everything. Amazing !!
That white layer on the Persimmons looked more like Mold on them, than "Sugar"! 
I think this is the heaven on earth really....
I want to dry some persimmons like this 🇵🇰🇵🇰🇵🇰
Suka nontonnya 
Like it !!!️
Feels like she lives in garden of eden. Abundance of food is everywhere.
Это же хурма!!! Привет из России. Только вопрос, почему она покрылась белым налётом, после того, как её достали из того большого  деревянного чана? Это искуственно было сделано или нет? Похоже па кондитерскую пудру.
Li said to her 婆婆 that persimmon was picked on a tree and was very sweet. (even on trees, persimmons are super tasty after frost)

柿子饼就是最好吃的！！！
Thank you JESUS for the food and nature

Nice video ️
Я пересмотрела все ролики на Вашем канале. Они успокаивают, и в то же время удивляют. Я поняла, что очень мало знала о китайском народе, и о природе Китая. Природа Сычуань великолепна. И бабушка Ваша очень хорошая, передавайте ей привет.
حس خیلی عالی داشت 
ممنون از ویدئوتون
Beautiful  !!!
황산 단감이 가을을 장식 하는구나 !
이제 추풍에 떨어진 낙옆들은 
흰눈에 덮dop여  따뜻한 봄꿈을 꾸겠네........
In my country, dried candied persimmons costs 1600 per 4 pieces. 
Super visuals to eyes.. 
i am new here.. and i fall in love with her contents..
I can understand a single word but i really enjoy watching your videos. Blessings from México 
당신의 작품을 좋아하고, 중국의 문화를 더 좋아하고, 당신에게서 배우세요.
Your videographer style is amazing and beautiful...
干し柿の紐付けてるとこって枝から切ってもまた来年も実はなるのかな？
I really really love this, girl
Check out Grandma's skill at peeling the skin in one!!
Your videos remind me of childhood with grandparents. I also come from Sichuan, everything looks similar with your village,  the mountain, the rain fog, and mother tongue. Really miss the most beautiful memory.
Beautyfull place like heaven
In what magical world does she live? Every little detail is full of beauty and wisdom!
Most satisfying video ever.
I seem to hate most humans, but I love these people.  I don't believe in a heaven, but this place seems so heavenly to me.
bisaan pisan eta teh. cantik, pinter ngurul alam. makan bakso dicampur #seblaqs. mantaps. salam dari indonesia
Lovely
Wow delicious fresh fruits
这几天一直在看子柒的视频，很有意境真享受生活！这就是我一直祈盼的生活。与世无争，静心惬意，所有的衣食全是自己动手而作，房前屋后，满是小花，绿草，几分田地种些喜爱的瓜果蔬菜。生活本该就像子柒的视频里描写的一样，享受它~！谢谢子柒给我回想的空间，谢谢！！！！
The sound of the howling wind made me melt into a pile of relaxed goo. Geez
the place is amazing
李子七仙女:佳佳新年將來了，先恭賀您新春快樂如意。感謝啦佳人心想圓滿如意思維成功。好朋友的祝福。
holy moly this area looks so peaceful
It is so amazing
Her videos are all amazingly beautiful, it's like back to nature thing. Too bad, there are many thieves stealing her videos without giving her credit and post it on different youtube account as it is real her  just to get "money".
في هدا الفديو هدوء وسكينة وطبيعة تتكلم حقا سبحان الله ما اجمل العيش في طبيعة الخالية من التطور عربية جزائرية مرت من هنا
Beautiful
Wonderfull...aku suka mbak liziqi ...
persimmons when ripe are very delicious and   she is beautiful

I'll prepare a bowl of an egg and some Tuna fish and onion fried in Peanut Oil, shredded cheese, cream cheese, and sweet cane and of Milk and Crushed Red Pepper Japanese Noodles and a little salt on a boiled egg and cup of sweet cane and MELON Water mixed in Milk for me to eat and drink this afternoon.
Look delicious. Nature . Very nice.

ฉันชอบวิถีชีวิตแบบพวกคุนมากคะ
Amazing bravoU r so patient

Amazing 
I hope to take a trip to this place someday. It heals my soul.
When I am sad, when I am bored and disappointed by the negative things in today's world, I come and retire here. Thank you for the mood you offer me.
Sending my warm regards 
After all the chaos from protest, riot, and pandemic, I just want to have a peaceful life.
今天的山好美。想去，子柒，請帶我去！
Good video takes time. Look at this Video. She collected the fruit in fall and dry them for months, and preserve them for winter. The whole video shooting lasted for at least 3 months. This is something you don't see often nowadays.
Your channel is healing for me
小時候一樣背著背篼  一放學回家就去打草 年紀大了， 越來越想小時候回憶
子柒的视频真的可以治疗抑郁，而且有助于睡眠

Tôi yêu cô gái này mất thôi
She is so talented and making bamboo furniture and I’m here trying to get and A+ in my test :(
ทั้งสวยและเก่งมากค่ะ
More power to u..i love it
Feel sorry for the dead persimmons and dried leaves
This idea for drying is nice
I love persimon, In Iran we eat a lot of those but not dried like this.
I love how there's not one single fly or nat   or bug around...
Oh my goodness, do you manage to use all this fruit before it goes to waste?
She peels it bit by bit. Granny does it in one take. She's the OG
Beautiful
You have an amazing ability to speed up time ...
Wow great fruits
beautiful place
Feel live like in paradise 
影片制作非常的精细，人美、景美，透出一缕恬淡的气息。美哉！
That’s some good camera quality and production

这是比较传统的柿饼制作方法了，柿饼外面的白色物质是糖类的凝结物，可以放心食用，白色物质越多柿饼越好，而我就是一个非常喜欢吃柿饼的人，当然，我也喜欢吃柿子，好怀念家乡的柿子啊！
Your videos make everyone to work like u.The god likes a woman like u.
In Malaysia we called that fruit is "pisang kaki" or scientific called is persimmon. Very nutritious and yummy.. #HellofromMalaysia🇲🇾️
Eu adoro seus vídeos 🇧🇷
Something from her in China feels like the only thing I can really trust! She shows it all, everything is healthy. Good to live, with multiple generations.
You are amazing. 
This blogger deserve more than a million of subscribers. Every video she make is very inspirational.
That's amazing
最讓我驚訝的不是剪輯，不是配樂，甚至不是顔值。是耐心。每一個片子的素材時間跨度都很大，這中間真的很容易出岔子，除非對素材的把控非常了得。
There are now many channels with the same concept but this gives me some aesthetic feeling 
Снег, розы, чай) видео залипательное))) а с какой легкостью и грацией все делается)))
Wow  i love this video , can't wait to see the next yt will recommendation.
Каждый вечер, перед сном,я смотрю ее видео,на душе спокойно становится,я бы все отдала ,чтобы так жить.
Liziqi, aku pengen main ke desamuu
Wow grandma still strong.... And healthy.. All the love for u grandma.
看李子柒的视频真的很治愈，非常田园，她在向全世界展示我们的中国文化
Your video makes my soul feel peaceful! That’s priceless!thank you ziqi!
هذي هيا جنة الأرض ممتازة اني أعرف قناتك
Por favor coloque legenda Brasil te assiste muito...
Luv pessimons.
How can I hv some?
After hour of watching......
Me: This is the last video I am going to watch 
Also Me: Maybe another one too 
I was already in my 20s when I first had persimmons. God those are delicious!
I feel speechless every time I watch her........
Princesa da Natureza!
A pessoa mais criativa que já vi.
Deus já à Abençoou!
Watch liziqi videos everyday before sleep... Makes me relax
Wow,fall in love with this place,heavn on earth
Wow - the cinematography, make up for the model ,& scenery for this channel is epic.
Здавствуйте.
Я восторге. Я могу вирости эту хурмо в Ташкенте. Вы поможите мне
I really love her....I wanna be like her....She's like the lost princess of Asia!!!
Selalu nyaman dan tenang ketika melihat video" nya Liziqi, seperti terbawa di dalam suasannya langsung. I am from Indonesia.   Liziqi
Why we have 17n dislikes? You dont love it? I cannot understand why people click dislike for a wonderful, peaceful video like this. She spent a lot of time and efforts for all videos. She deserves to have more likes and encouragement.
Love you Liziqi....
เป็นความสุขที่แท้จริง
I'd give anything to live with her and her grandma for a week/month just to experience this peaceful life. Though I understand that it's actually difficult to bc it could be pretty stressful, but I'd still go for it. Feels like a once in a lifetime opportunity don't you think? 
Post new videos,i watched all the videos repeatedly,waiting for the new one
Am I the only one feeling peaceful 
I bet her family is 100% greatful and glad they have this girl in their life.
My mom is your biggest biggest fan...you are awesome liziqi....God Bless You and Grandma...love from India
ماشا الله
her grandma deserves to live foreverr!️
Would love to visit your place.
One of my best YouTube channel,, always give me peace,Nd waoo such a girl.
Nd she lives in tottaly sourounding by nature sooo lovely️️
Seandainya aku punya halaman seluas itu, pasti aku tanami banyak tumbuhan, buah dan sayur seperti kakak liziqi, sehat selalu untuk nenek dan kak liziqi
She seems to have everything available as needed.
She is like a  Disney Queen in fairy tale too me.  She is  inspiring and real life Disney Queen . She is a good role model in so many level; hardworking, kind, talented etc.. if they had made a Disney movie inspired by her character , she would be my favorite next to forozen Queen.🇵🇬🇵🇬🇵🇬. Watching her is like a therapy session for me after cracking my head with books all day
chj ấy giỏi quá đi xem những video này luôn mang lại cảm giác thoải mái cho mn đúng ko ạ
Allahım video çok güzel
The beauty of nature!
We have persimmons here to but never that big~USA

Those persimmon looked so good I'm courious,as to how,they taste.TFS.
น่ารัก
She is really amazing 
Wow️
I love how she works together with her Granny. Sweet!
To the people who say they want to live like this—it’s harder than it looks. It requires a lot of labor and skill that takes a long time to learn.
Look how many people feel a connection to this. Maybe this is how humans were meant to live.
Amazing place I whish I'm there
So much beauty in her videos it's awe inspiring
I love your video, im one of your fans.
She is living my imaginary life . I wish I could live like that .
Todo lo dejas para que uno use la imaginacion,  felicidades
Long process but love the video and really like the beautiful sceneries
It's my first time coming to this channel, and I will watch all of the videos here. It's such a healing show like the Little Forest movie.
Thank you for the vegetarian video! I love this.
Delicious
This ladie makes me feel relaxed  GOD bless her 
Wow I love it
Hello Li Zikai, I really enjoyed this video congratulations. Here in my country (Brazil) we have this persimmon fruit, I will try to make this preserve just like you did. I'll check if I can. Gratitude. I love the way you be. 你好李子凱，我真的很喜歡這個視頻祝賀。在我的國家（巴西），我們有這種柿子果實，我會盡量像你一樣做這個保存。我會檢查一下是否可以。感恩。我愛你的樣子。
I want to spend my next winter in this farm 
Wow...love it...so amazing 
Satisfying video and relax also
I  never imagined tat I would  end up getting addicted to these
I always watch you even I'm from Philippines I'm half chineese half filipino my father is chineese my Chinese name is kaw chien zheng even I don't understand all you're language because I only learn mandarin And little fukien in my father's family only my father can speak multiple chineese language he past away when I was 12 today I live my own to survive by watching you're chanel I learn a lot
Beautiful in every way.
Although obviously very capable, I think she would enjoy someone to help carry that basket.
I volunteer 
i’ve watched this like 50 times but it never gets old
What a beautiful place 

曾经的中国几千年来的田园生活，无处不展现出中国人的智慧、文化传承与生活之美，现在中国人都在城市快节奏的生活，恐怕再也回不去了。谢谢子柒给我们制作的视频，美好的记忆能时时重温，虽看似平凡但感人至深！
Love from India 
Absolutely beautiful video!!!
هاي البنت فيديوهاتها تجيب راحة نفسية 
Persimmon!!!! Want some! It would be fun picking them.. what a nice picturesque view..
Почему я не живу там? Мой любимый фрукт... вкуснотища и красотища.
this should be the life, the kind of world we had in mind
THANK YOU!  BRAVO!  SUPER!
ما شاء الله  كل ما اطلبه من ربي أن يرزقني انا وعيلتي ببيت وسط الطبيعة وناكل مما نزرع  يا رب وترزق امي الصحة والعافية وتجمعني فيها

不但可以赚钱也可以让她的粉丝过过山野世外桃源如仙境一般的假日旅游。
Looks like heaven on earth n the beginning. Beautiful nature
Kak keren konten nya...ajarin dong ka biar bisa sukses seperti anda..
A simple lifestyle, a happy and wonderful living.
Wait, so what is her story? Do they own that land? Working the land? I mean, they like, have everything
外出打拼的異鄉遊子們，雖然現實生活無奈要離鄉背井去工作賺錢 但也別忘了在故鄉守候等著孩子回鄉的親人，有空常回家去探望吧，珍惜有親人遠在家鄉守候的溫暖，祝平安幸福
youtube我至少看了10年以上，从未想过进频道来说话。
今天为了子柒，第1次登录，第1次留言，把我的第1次献给子柒。
不为别的，只是单纯于沉浸在你的世界里，衷心祝福你！
谢谢你给我们带来的所有，一切都是那么美好！
Mi bebé

超爱吃柿子饼，今天才知道是怎么做的，谢谢子柒！^_^

Which place in China it is???it's sooo beautiful...I m mesmerized ️
Que e llama ese fruto
Saludos.
老太太真不容易，这么大岁数了不用戴眼睛竟然还能削出这么漂亮的皮，手不抖。但愿老人家身体健康，长命百岁，这样柒姐才可以专心制作视频。
heaven on earth ️
これは何かのドキュメンタリーかなんかでしょうか？？
そのくらいカメラアングルの移り変わりが綺麗です。
まあどっちにしても、こういう自然と共存する暮らし、めちゃめちゃ憧れるしこうありたいとと思います。
The fruit & flowers are so abundant in your area. Is there nothing that can be grown there.?
疫情期间我才看到她的视频、从此经常关注、拍得非常不错
Well done 
李子柒的视频充分展现了中国人农耕文明的智慧与生活哲学。
ڤيديوهات هاد الآنسة الجميلة كنلقاهم سبحان الله تجسيد لحديث "رحم الله من عمل عملا فأتقنه" كل شيء ينفد بدقة متناهية
很想念在农村晨起时的光景。清清草木香，唧唧虫鸣声。雨露粘湿脚，濛雾绕山腰。妈妈灶前煮饭，我坐门坎醒神。
what kind of video camera do you use in your videos?
Ото керемет дуйно тартуулаган Аллахым бизге!Кыргызстандан салам .!!!
super i love it very much
she is so pretty like Goddesses in fantasy Chinese dramas
柿饼是我的最爱哟。视频已经连看三遍。
这姑娘的视频在油管竟然点击这么高，她一个人就实现了舌尖上的中国一个团队的文化输出
She is so amazing
i kinda wish i was raised in this kind of enviornment. i know that if i quit my lifestyle to live how she does, i’m not going to last even a week without craving tech.
I Love 
Amazing... Speechless...
Looks very good, for the biggest channel in china.
Aaaaah!!!!! ......

Thank you.
Omg pure beauti
I don’t know what part of China this is (hint...tell me) but, it looks like paradise.
Qué rico
大自然真不錯^~^短短幾分鐘長長攝影時 辛苦了
Has anyone ever mentioned how pretty she is and how wonderful her videos are?
What fruit is this? Have never seen it. What is its taste I don' t know. I want to see and taste it.
Awesome place
缘来生活可以这么美妙！
No need to see english translation,their language is fine the way it is..
I knew she wasn't going to waste the skin of that fruit.
哇塞。风景如画真想去看看
用麻绳把柿子吊起来，晾柿子的画面我竟然看哭了！不仅美，而且满满的幸福感溢出屏幕！想起了儿时家乡的柿子树，儿时的伙伴，故乡已远～～～
Одна женщина в одиночку на такой большой ферме все делает и без мужиков.
馋了，好想吃柿饼。
再配一壶茶，看雪。
哭了，太馋了。
seandainya kita boleh sepertinya dan youtuber dari seluruh negara lainnya(terkenal) 
Очень люблю хурму!
My wife is from Guangzhou China. So cute, lovely and super smart. I love China ~ ^0^

柿のなってる田舎の風景、好きなんだよね
Recently discovered her channel and I'm blown away. Such a genuine, gentle, loving person!
Such a soulful video..... Love the fact  how she shares meal with grandma.... Such a peaceful n soothing video
I from Indonesian i like your vidios
If I live to be a thousand years, I'm still not going to be as wise and knowledgable as this lady. She's truly amazing!
freakin china they do everything better than the rest of us D:, i kinda wanna visit china, and stay if i like it
好奇怪我现在重复打开她最早的视频每次都流泪看完。。literally 美哭了
2:11 that’s so cute the grandma is peeling it in her speed , The relationship between her and her grandma is so beautiful
I know it took so long to creat those, it’s beautiful the way she shows us and the different seasons ️
Beautiful location! Great preparation into persimmons. I love persimmons! Thank you!
32k gave a thumbs down ?  So weird
Every video is incredible! The snow and flowers is bewildering to me. I love everything about this. Pure living. Soooooo beautiful!
Your fans have a Facebook page with your name on it. Please share your videos. Miss you 
干し柿…昔お婆ちゃんが作ってた…懐かしいな～
Caqui eu gosto. Aí que jardim lindo. Comia muito quando era criança eles pendurados ficou parecendo uma obra de arte
I love dried persimmons like those. I always choose the ones that have thick layer of white coat because they are the sweetest. I can’t get enough of sweet dried persimmons 
I love and love videos and follow you from Iraq 
New subscriber, and I’m hooked  never seen such a more beautiful magical mysterious place and you make it even better I feel peace warmth & love I’m enjoying everything about ur videos especially the way you interact with grandma love to hear you both laughing what more can I say the food looks amazing the clothes you make are stunning the furniture  is unique organic like everything else .. 

Also, I like to watch when you pick & cut down the fruits and flowers off the trees then to top it off you arrange them so lovely who would think that little simple thing like that could be so therapeutic and calming to my soul .. 
Keep up the good work you will go very far with those amazing  talantes that God has giving you / you are a very especial young lady God bless 

Thank you for sharing

Nice video
I could watch all these videos a million times and still find them entertaining.
look so beautiful place
This literally looks like someone went back in time and recorded this woman doing her thing
There is the same dried persimmon in Japan. But the saving method is different. A great way to save. Looks more delicious than Japan. I respect her who can do anything. It is a great person.
Have you noticed how every bush, plant and tree is loaded with an abundance of fruits or vegetables? Everything seems to grow so well there. I couldn't believe how loaded those trees were!!!!
the white sugar is so cool
Love the menu's and
always has something soft for granny to eat. Having found Liziqi, I've slowly
come out of depression and started to cook again. Thank you dear lady, your
videos are medicine for me. Much better than pills
Liziqi your such an wonderful women....... I lov u so much..... 
Strong  woman.. You inspiration  for women  in the world.. I love your channel...im from Indonesia.. 🇮🇩
Who would unlike this video! Why so many thumbs down tf is wrong with it. She’s amazing
Love this lady!  Such abundance there.  Surprizing the wild animals don’t het it all first.
Amazing
I love how in all her videos every now and then she samples whatever it is.
好治愈
Now this is a good way to spend 5 minutes.
I love persimmons very much, but only the soft ones   Wonder how do those dried persimmons she made taste like 
熟した柿、干し柿、どちらも美味しそう  柿をとるだけで、こんなに絵になるなんて  素敵です

from  japan

Where in China is this? 

This is the only channel that I have subscribed & pressed the bell button & commenting also

身处凡尘之中，而远离世俗之外，这是陶渊明笔下的世外桃源么，感谢子柒，唤醒了我们每个人的田园梦
I just need a silent place where my thoughts don’t disturb my mind

سبحان الله ️
ये जगह बहुत ही सुन्दर है। इनसे जुड़ी हर चीज बेहतरीन है। काश की मै यहाँ कभी जाकर इनसे मिल पाती ।  i  love evryyhing 
감말랭이 만들어 나중에 줘용

فكرة حلوة
Хурма 
liziqi你的厨艺非常好吃
谢谢这个视频让我觉悟，看来从来不缺乏美 只是缺乏发现美的眼睛。。。

Really nice videos and cooking style. I wish To visit this place. I tried couple items at home - and it came out good . Thank you
How far away this but so beautiful
What a neat insight into how people live on the other side of the world from New Zealand

Just discovered your channel and  I can't stop watching now 
Im dreaming of a life like yours,far from a crowded city,working so natural and close to god and to the nature its like peace is every where in your country,u r also super caring to your grandma.

Actually stunning how something so beautiful can be so real wish I could see it with my own eyes

Awesome Lifestyle, Love your lifestyle
Watching liziqi is always so relaxing...utilizing lockdown
شنو هل جمال  واوو شي عجيب اتمنى اعيش يوم واحد هنا صدك روعععععععه
Masya Allah, buahnya melimpah ruah 
I love dried persimmons  Though, I thought that the white stuff was powdered sugar added to make them sweeter. Who would have thought, that it forms naturally?!
️️️️️Form Thailand
I have read u r life story. U r such an inspiring women.  How can someone be so positive even after so much of struggle and hardship. U r care for u r granny, amazing
I love you liziqi 
When the snow came down and you just sit there  with a cup of tea..itss beautifulll

Ademm bener dah kalo liat ginian
I want to live in the place like this. It's a paradise. No cars, no buildings, no pollution. Everything is naturally perfect and peaceful. 
How feeling is wow
一串串柿子挂起来的时候，感动的哭了      因为美，因为馋，更因为乡愁 
Everything is so picture perfect, I wish I had magical powers to transport myself there.
看了子柒的柿饼，又让我想起了老家，柿饼跟我老家的做法不一样。我们老家小孩子拉稀，都要吃柿饼，老人说是正气。前几年。我小孩拉稀跟我爸说了，我爸给我寄来了老家的柿饼。我们这代人就是离老家太远了。学不到子柒的孝道。祝福子柒越做越好。
she inspires me to work harder in my everyday life!
如果做這些事情 讓你覺得很快樂   不管別人怎麼說你都可以繼續做你愛做的事  別因為別人幾句話改變你獨特的風格
Ah..what's the name of that apple like fruits 
The reality is we all want this kind of life..even watching this so peaceful n soothing.... I have smile on my face throughout the vedio....
Heaven on the Earth. You people staying in heaven.
Her name is Liziqi she is an orphan and her parents already passed away when she was small she lives with her grandma and I even heard she sets up camera everything by herself she used to stay in city but she came back to her village to take care of her grandma as her grandpa passed away
I lost myself watching her videos  
Thank you for making such a peaceful video
Какая великолепная природа; горы - просто чудо! Никогда не видела, чтобы чистили хурму! Как здорово придумали китайцы - вяленная сладость в высушенных шкурках! Удивительная нация!!!
kingdom of fruits and vegetables
Sure, her portrayal of a lot of things is overly romanticized, but she still does all the work to make it enjoyable and we should appreciate that
Good 
Shes so beautiful and talented! I wish I could be like her..
I feel in love with your videos.. loving nature.
Que bonito ese entorno. This is impressive
Jadi pengen pulang ke sna kampung nenek
i remember when i ate my first persimmon, and this video feels how it tastes
你好，我来自越南，我非常喜欢你。 祝你和她永远健康 <3
Я  просто в восторге от Неё и её занятия)))
Pengen banget suatu hari nanti tinggal di tempat seperti ini
I think she will live for 120 years because she is eating food made with fresh fruits and vegies if you agree hit like
И умница и красавица. И всё то у тебя в руках ладно и складно получаетсялюбо дорого смотреть
Stuffing dried persimmons with pealed skin in the barrel is unique way for me. 
I've never seen like that way.
Jadi pengen pulang ke sna kampung nenek
I was wondering what she's going to use the peel for then bam. That is genius. I love persimmons and I love her.
ماشاء الله تبارك الله الله
Wish we can go back to simple life, on electricity, no computer, no WeChat, no handphone, no processed food, or fast food.
Thích cuộc sống này thật bình yên ️
WOW!!! This is absolutely beautiful. Thanks for the share.
Ini mungkin Nama nya buah kesemek yg viral di Lombok 2017...buah aneh menurut ku...
OMG, I've always had MAD RESPECT for Chinese culture -- for how they turned basic survival into fucking BEAUTIFUL ART, but... this ANGEL-GODDESS keeps blowing my mind! This is AMAZING  #IWANT 

She must live in the garden of eden where everything grows well.
I like her, like her all activities how she is doing. It looks like I'm in a quit calm and peaceful place where i can stay all day long. No harsh music, no graphics and more of them there is no artificial things that embarrassed us. Wish you good luck
I am 100% positive that Li Ziqi is an ancient forest spirit that roams rural China making beautiful videos and delicious food.

Hola me gusta mucho todo lo que haces he mirado tus vidios me encanta donde vives tienes de todo y como cuydas a tu mamá eres muy trabajadora  te saludo desde Ecuador un país lindo
You are your life so better Always people face difficulties in our time but here is better and be out of the real world
People keep saying she is an actress with a big team support behind, but what I see is she has rough hands
I remember, My grandma used to make that dried persimmon (Hoshi Gaki) in Japan.
Beautiful I love that fruits 
There is such a abundance of things that grow around there or that you plant such blessings
She is so creative and filled with smartness and loved
What's name of the fruit?
Какая красота,слов нет.
You try to give the video more brightness it will be great if you do
看出诗意来了。和姥姥一起削柿子看了很温馨。采摘，挂晾都甚是好看。可以就这么一直挂着吗？

The province in which she lives is called “ Land of plenty”
I had persimmons recently and when they're sweet... THEY'RE SWEET DX
She is an angel and she lives in Haven
xem kênh của chị ko biết chán luôn ️
Nhìn cái vườn trái cây phát thèm 
Its a heaven
Никогда не видела сады хурмы. Очень красиво. Пожалуйста, напишите сколько лет вашей бабушке?
Her videos reminds me of the scenes from the untamed and the music.
柿がとても美味しそう、我が家でも同様に干し柿を作ってます。
One thing that I jealous is that she can eat that persimmons as much as she wantsbut here in my country that fruit is quite expensive
人間仙境世外桃源。 不簡單的女孩。 做平淋漓盡致。 真善美。
ഹായ്  ലിസീഗി ചേചി നിങ്ങളുടെ വീടിയോസ് സൂപ്പർ ആണ്...
This (growing food) should be more valuable that any carrier in the world.
This fruit is the best. Lots in Guanxi.
I am from Turkey, my  mom does this..
I love persimmon so every time I'm craving for it i will watch this video and that pomelo video because i like pomelo too
The amount of patience it takes to film this is beyond my capacity

您所居住的地方是天堂。真的很美，我真的很喜歡 . Nơi bạn sống quả là thiên đường. Thật sự rất đẹp, tôi rất thích nó .
I love ur videos i want to come ur village
China is a blessed country. ..
Different different thing they have ... all r lovely pepole
wow I had no idea that you'd dry unripe persimmons and let it ripe from inside
...interesting!
はー、干し柿が食べたくなりました。美味しいんだろうな。
So what does a persimmon taste like? I’ve never had one. I see the name and it reminds me of cinnamon and a fragrant spicy flavor.
Apaixonei japonesa
I watch very fondly
Suka banget sama semua videonya Li ziqi,
️
I would have given anything to be in paradise with her
persimo, delicioso!!!
She’s living the dream, literally.
انتي رائعه
I really like this Vlog. Especially her place
I love you Li Ziqi 
我三年学习中文。。 所以我一点儿说中文。 现在我要学习中国文化。 谢谢您。
The persimmon looks delicious. i want to eat
Mình cũng muốn cuộc sống như thế quá đi như cảnh đẹp như trong phim vậy thíc quá

I am so happy for her at least she is leaving the life I wanted , may God bless her with all the happiness 
Суперь  ради вашего канала казахи ставить лайк было бы моя воля миллиард поставил бы живи радуйся но мешает не обращай внимание как немец друг сказал
she lives in forest But More happy than city people
怀念小时候每年秋天吃柿饼的日子了！good old time
綺麗すぎてこの人が実在するのか分からなくなる
なんでこの人のことを悪くいう人がいるんだろね。見てて嫌な気持ちになる訳じゃないのに
コロナに気をつけて下さいね(*´˘`*)
I really miss your videos. I hope you will post something one day but I hope you are  safe there 
She is wonderful 
Peaceful 
Even  hard days at the office can be enjoyed if you love what u are doing

我只要和你说谢谢
I just want to say thank you 
Thank you. What a neat way to store persimmons. cheers.
Точно говорят:женщина прекрасна в труде!
The sad thing is that before industrialization and modernization, most humans lived in small tribes in the nature and made everything on their own, like Li Ziqi. In fact, humans were happier and had bigger brains back then. It's a lot of hard work, but we were designed for it.
為什麼沒有中文字幕？？
こんにちは、いつ見ても元気そうで、お美しいですね️(*☻-☻*)
In this cruel world, I didn't knew that such peaceful life exists.
jesus, she's able to eat fresh khaki just straight from the tree, i'm jealous
️️
Im a taino indian from puerto rico and these videos remind me of the rain forest where i grew up. We picked and grew dried and cultivated food..now days its almost nonexistent, thank you for this beautiful memory thru this video.

After watiching your videos  .feeling inner peace
This is so magical. love it. Even though China is no one in plastic production traditional Chinese life style was equipped with wooden stuff. We should go back to that culture to put an end to pollution
I just wanna go to her village it's so beautiful
Everything about this woman is beautiful ...her hard work,her surroundings,her clothes, her home,her grandmother and herself.
So wow.. loving all your videos... i love your countryside
It is god's grace to live in a paradise of the paradise of his land. 
there is someone who lives in this wonderful nature and is getting depressed
I want to cry.  
How in a blessing she is. 
We go on a trip in the desert and rejoice 
If we go on a trip to this place, I doubt it's  Solve crazy .

Ayy cennet hurmasi canım çekti vallahi 
The golden land
Never have I ever seen such a beautiful fruit tree, and I thank you for showing this to us.
Ước có vườn trái cây như này
And the skipping scenes show that she did it all alone,probably with a timer on a tripod.
A talented young lady.Bravo !
Frist time am seeing this fruit
Beacuse am living Kerala
Our Guangdong style persimmon cake is not peeled and is flatter. But the frosty white dust is the same; it is evaporated sugar solution from the fruit, not mold. I tend to think Guangdong persimmon cake is made from Fuyu.
Will anyone tell me where is this place?
I started watching these videos before bed. She is an amazing, amazing young lady. She's a WARRIOR of everything. She can build furniture, draw, embroider, sew, cook, paint..........she's an amazing talent.
She is my favorite youtuber. She lives my dream life.
Am from kerala india i can't blv this.. gods creation of nature beauty..  i wish to live for one day here
nice ️️ from 🇱🇰🇱🇰🇱🇰
Deep down we all know this is the meaning of true life
How many of you are interested to stay with liziqi at her home
I'm like craving everything she prepares and the scenery is beautiful.
Any maps of where she lives? Would be cool to see the resource and crop distribution/allocations for the area.
We never knew that this fruit can be dried. Thank you for the interesting video. Big greetings from Ukraine.
She’s a chinese right? Hope she is safe and so her grandma! Hope all over the world is safe and this pandemic will be over soon
Omg grandma knifing skills is supert! How come some people can peeling fruit skin without tearing it off!?

That squeeze was so satisfying!
masahallah very nice video liziqi
Ya me hacía falta uno de estos videos! Me dan una paz...
Bless her heart she takes care of her granny
Fruits and fruits every where this makes me so happy
sublime.
I like her because of her rustic and simplicity
Hello I am wondering if you would be able to help me with a problem in mine and my boyfriends garden there has been some insects eating at a few of our plants and I was wondering if you can you can help with a organic way to get rid of them
Amo 🇧🇷️
Person: How many persimmons are we gathering?



Liziqi: YES.
Peeled persimmons for a long time can be contagious but may not be in neat/clean environment.
Superb
So beautiful 

The ways that they would peel the fruit differently!!! It was a tiny thing but it just jumped out as so sweet and interesting to me!!!
Can anyone pls tell me where this place is, I am in love with her locations..heavenly️️
She is the coolest woman on YouTube right now, I love all the food she cooks.
كتير عجبني شغلا وعيشتا واديش تهتم بل زراعة عنجد برافو 
So we should hang these for days before storing them? Exactly for how long should we air dry please?
I really love eastern women for this
This chanel gives very relaxment I want this type of life style
I watch your video and rember my mom,she was watched it with me and now she leave the world

干し柿
Every time I salute you when I watch ur videos,
ഇത് എന്താ fruit.

ഞങ്ങളുടെ നാട്ടിൽ എന്താണോ ഇതിനു പേരെന്നറിയില്ല. സൂപ്പർർർർ..
Wonder who taught Qi to peel the skin vertically while granny peels horizontally.  Her dried persimmons look closer to あんぽ柿, my favorite.
Hope you  and gramma. Are  safe  we are praying  for everyone   luv  from America
Her and her basket's way stronger than me and my backpack :">
Hi i lik ur vedios i watch it again n again ur very tallented n beautiful also reply me in english lots of love 
All she does is work hats off to her
Are there any people from China who watch her channel? I'm curious. Liziqui must have family member in government for her to have so much.
The beauty of oriental culture in a nutshell. So touching and inspiring.
Beautiful place!
I'm always waiting for your videos and now i watch your today's amazing video so i feel so happy.
She is a genius, lets follow her examples,I like her
너무멋진영상~♡

It is so relaxing watching your videos makes my nerves calm 
I love how nothing is wasted....all is used for something.....whether for human, or animal consumption.....
You are more beautiful than life itself, the most talented woman in the world and more graceful than all the angels above. THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR TALENTS BUT, ABOVE ALL THANK YOU FOR SHARING A PART OF YOUR LIFE. YOU ARE  MY INSPIRATION AND I JUST ADORE YOU!!!
She has patience level infinity....
Her house just so peaceful, with all the flowers, fruits and bird chirping.
So good
好冷的天气，美丽的妹妹配美景！加油！

I love your grandmother,  greetings from Mexico.
꽂감이다!! 어릴적 시골 생각나요. 구독합니다.
欣賞美麗的農場
اوكي 
I'm obsessed! How does she keep the flies away while she is drying things outside like that?
️️️️️️
OMG I really love persimmon and I could only eat during new year idk why but it's so damn expensive in our country
hello, I'd like to know what kind of persimmons are they. I've got a persimmon tree but when they ripen they fall down from the tree. how could I keep them up? Is that a particular kind of persimmon? thank you
Pensa numa pessoa qqe ama teus videos se eu pudesse me transporta pros teu videos eu o faria
todos aqui hablan en otro idioma creo pero que yo sepa asta hora nadie habla español pero si alguien habla español un saludo xd
Very beautiful.

很感动，感谢有这么多人喜欢李子柒的视频
Wow soo beautiful place and how beautiful is paradise May b 100%more
This fruit sweet and we called sheem hei in Maring dialect, India. Love from Machi, Manipur, India
الللللله المكان خيالي اتمنه اجي يوم واحد بس واااااو 
Nhật Bản họ cũng hay phơi như vậy. Nhưng thời tiết của họ khô và lạnh hơn nên phơi nhanh hơn. :)))
very nice
The Birds were so smart that they didn’t eat any persimmons and left them for princess
I,m so happy video liziqi
Finally 1 M congrats!! 🇧🇩
看到这视频我哭了，这正是大多数人想要的生活吧。
诗情画意不过与此！浮躁世界的镇定剂！美到哭了！
​
Definitely all those food is not consuming herself and may be having extended family but videos presentation with grandma, we should appreciate her hardwork

4:35 when that part came out I literally gasped. When I thought this video can't be any more beautiful, that scene came out.
She inspired me. Thank you
Just beautiful
Love u liziqi sis
I'm just in love with the place where she lives
In Nepal we call it haluwabed.
作为一个四川人，我要说，四川真的很美，任何一座山都是青山绿水。喜欢小时候跟着外公外婆在成都的日子，慢生活无压力，跟着外婆去买菜、洗菜、磨豆浆，跟着外公去茶馆、影院、去寺庙附近吃斋菜。一个人有了生活的能力和乐趣，就会自信和坚强。小时候会羡慕父母一直在身边的孩子，长大了以后发现外公外婆给了我最好的爱，勤快和包容。
مشاءالله آلله الله واكبر
شىء خيالى روعه 
I would trade all my knowledge, my job, everything only to live a life time as hers...bless you.
BEAUTY OF CHINA IS NEVER ENDING.
So that's how you make dried persimmons!
She made a sound when she took a bite of the persemmon
놀러가고 싶게 만드는 영상이네요 bgm도 좋다

It takes 3 seasons to make
Also that winter looks freezing 
这个好吃！看到口水都流！！
Оте керемет жарайсын

Кереметко

Now that's what I call a beautiful place
Beautiful

A real princess 

四季折々の　フルーツ
干し柿　栄養満点
She is so pretty in such a peaceful place.
This is heaven
I thank you so much to see your fantastic cooking idea and beautiful...
Beautiful
Je sais enfin comment conserver mes kakis. Magnifique.
Thấy cảnh vật cây trái như thế này à tôi thấy nhẹ. Lòng quá k biết mọi người như thế nào ?
Normally Indians are the first people to glorify their culture when something negative is spoken about some other country.

This video is showing beauty of some other country. That explains their absence!
Love from India
I think not easy but Her's way of life is beautiful.
最喜欢吃柿子。我要是有这么多柿子树的话。那简直就是土豪的感觉啊
I would Leave every comfort to live your life. Because this is living. You inspired me to be strong and independant

strong woman ️

I love what you are doing. You are really wonderful and you are also his artist
I'm following you from Palestine  the Middle East
انتي رائعه جدا 🇵🇸
اللهم رضاك والجنه️
Я бы не смог донести эту корзину с хурмой,- я бы её съел всю по дороге!
Satisfying Video
I think I've watched this for 5 times now.
Madam please up load your new videos
最後那個滿滿的柿霜真漂亮.
Welcome people around the world come and visit Sichuan province ( the state is in southwest China)! The rural place where is this girl firming and living. True Heaven on Earth!
1 M subscribers i wish i need a sister like you....
Os vídeos delas são viciantes. Assistir quando se está tendo ansiedade, insônia, nervosismo e stress é ótimo, recomendável.
Her efforts and talent is just amazing. I remember her saying that the process of making this kind of video is not that easy.Her videos are my stress reliever 
사랑해 
Wow, I never knew you could dry persimmons, I love this video ️.  You work so hard my dear Li Ziqi , my respect to you and your dear grandma who thought you very well !!!
️️
Everytine i watched historical c-drama i always thought is those beautiful views were real or not, where they find those scenery. Now i'm watching it and this is reaaalll
Watching ur videos gives a beautiful feeling of calmness n peace... Keep posting more... Thank u n ur efforts r highly appreciated
Everything you do looks so beautiful and aesthetically pleasing, it brings calmness to my soul. Thank you for sharing with us.
amazing
I am a new subscriber and i watched almost half of your videos uploaded here. Please continue making videos like this. We love you! ️
️
Today, my grand mother give me some of this fruit.
Such a great mountain, to have so many mature and various fruit trees along with the many other things she's harvesting in the videos. Someone old and with forsight skillfully planted this with future needs in mind.
I could easily state this about all of these videos, but this one definitely is one of my absolute favourites!!! I love the background music; I wish I had something like this to listen to for hours! :)
Please tell the place name,,what is your village name?
I love watching your videos. It's a stress reliever Thanks Liziqi.

这些柿子让我想到了我的小时候。我和我的姐姐一人背个小书包去采柿子，我们跟在两个老公公（我妈妈的爷爷和他的朋友）后面，学着他们把手背在身后，一摇一摆的走路，一边走一边笑。尽管他们十几年前就去世了，但是这段回忆我却一直记得。
wow that's so freaking cool!! with the persimmons and well, liziqi herself, of course ️
Such a beautiful intelligent woman,  thanks for sharing your videos
Danxi Xiaoge and Li ZiQi is my Favoriteeeee
The women always told me Im too good for them - I thought they were lying - and then I saw Lizigi's lifestyle
Manta
There is only cultural exchange, and no political struggle. This is the most real life and love. Why can’t human beings respect each other and respect other people’s life？respect for other people’s cultural traditions and social values ？
when i watch this video filing smooth
congratulations  1million subscribers
كل ما اشوف هاذي البنت ابكي وأتذكر ايام طفولتي

Farmers may not have much cash to live in a luxury life, but they can live in a self sufficient, affordable, spacious, and healthy life style.  We can’t have it in the city.

作為法國人，我尊重亞洲人，你有大城市，但這個美麗的國家有許多美麗的綠色景觀。你努力工作 我說尊重
Ммммм.....какая вкусная хурма.
so lovely from Bangladesh
nice nice liziqi    good job    am from ethiopia
The red rose in the snow just caught me off guard. Her life is my fantasy

Persimmons, i remember jang geum 

好怀念以前老家那里 家家户户都种满柿子的时候呀 后来城市发展 后院变成了水泥地 柿子只能去超市买吃了  发展永远伴随着失去 哎.....晚上要看满天星星都得去露营了现在。老了吧 原来越怀念以前的时光 
Whenever this video pops up in my feed, I instantly watch it. Actually its my 6th time  truly deserved millions of views, likes and subscribers.
Lugar lindo! U. Sonho de consumo

Everything is so beautiful beyond words ️

I love u and your food, anyway i love your country. Beautiful of China️️️
Eu me sinto muito bem em assistir você gosto muito de cuidar das plantas e tenho uma simples horta aqui é uma região muito quente e é um sufoco para as hortaliças
Très contente de voir ces vidéos, elle me fait rappeler mon enfance. Une fille courageuse, intelligente, autonome. Elle a une vie tres agréable. bcp de monde veut passer une vie comme elle.
I miss your long videos
Eat these stuff in autumn. Now I see how they are elegantly made. Look simple but so beautifully illustrated. How she left the stalk and a bit of stem for the string to connect is a real eye opener for me

我最喜欢吃滴柿饼~
Hi Lisiqi, you are really cool! I enjoy your videos! I'm from Germany! You are an international star of a better way of life in the village and the nature far from city, where people are lost in smog and traffic and far from the freedom to do everything themself for themselves, just as they want and need. Instead they have to work industrially in plants day by day without happiness.
I wish your mountain home was a retreat! I would love to visit up there for a few weeks! It's like a paradise!
Please show us how to dry fish one day....thxx
Love to watch her video before bed. Feels really peaceful and relaxing. It becomes a habit now.
Thank you
Food for the soul, sadly lacking in our modern way of life, prepared with deep respect and an intimate connection to mother earth, nowonder we watch transfixed as if rediscover​ing something we lost long ago
Wanna have a lifestyle like her. So peaceful 
Im from russia🇷🇺 and i steel wondering how chineses makeing interesting things from usual things
I wish I can live in that kind of countryside with luscious fields of fruits and veges️Love all her videos️da bestest️
What a wonderful place it is full of trees, clouds,wind, snow,and mountains 
I am in LOVE 

Eu que pensava que um verdadeiro paraíso era somente no céu,esse lugar é um verdadeiro paraíso
We call this fruit tindu
看到柿饼，就想起过世的奶奶。
她总会把我叫到跟前，给我一块柿饼，问我甜不甜...
The Chinese way of preserving foods always fascinates me. She didn't used any oil or salt but it looks super delicious and comforting in the winter months.
I've seen these "dusty" looking persimmons in the store before and never knew it was a layer of sugar that developed from drying them. My family had a persimmon tree growing up. My grandpa and I loved eating the soft squishy ones but the crunchy ones were also very tasty!
Wow so nice. ......
Nada mejor que vivir rodeado de la naturaleza, en mi querido México también se disfruta de eso, sobre todo en los pueblos rurales.

Nothing better than living surrounded by nature, here in Mexico, we experience that but in small villages away from city.

Greetings from Mexico.

台灣也有柿子，不過我們這天熱螞蟻特多，不用十分鐘就被中螞蟻大軍攻占啃光，還是純欣賞子柒巧手做柿餅過乾隱吧!
Uau fico adimirada com a forma que vcs vivem a cada estacao
Какая прелесть этот канал. Чудо. Даже настроение поднимается.
I think she is the most wonderful wamen i see in my life
I always see the final product at my grandparent's place but I never knew that this is how you make it! interesting video!
I like this
Truely shes really pretty and this land is like heaven.
I'm from China, and I'm proud of Liziqi, who presents our culture and civilization, even if who brings back all my old childhood memories in village, wonderful years, also I miss my grandmother so much. Chinese always love peace and hardworking from time immemorial . Welcome every friends to visit China.^_^
I want to be like her hardworking simple beautiful and so talented love you beautiful princess 
My parent have a persimmon tree and it’s the sweetest compared to store bought. I want to taste her persimmons to see how sweet it is. lol
Simple yet a beautiful life she’s living..way better than city life
Giỏi quá
What I like most about these videos is that they teach you to be resourceful.
What is name of this place 
I would be a very lucky man to know this woman.
I 'm in love with her life..so calm and peaceful.i want to live there 
She is a hard working girl with miserable childhood, she creats everything through her hands. She is a hero for us as ordinary persons. She makes us know Nothing is Impossible.

Imagine it being hundreds of years ago, you're a hungry lost traveller and you stumble upon this place. With the beautiful gardens full of vibrant colors, the happy animals roaming around freely, and the calming sounds of the birds and water and wind lulling you into a state of tranquility you've never felt before. And then seeing the sweet maiden working peacefully to take care of herself and her grandmother. You'd never want to leave.

As a Chinese, i wanna say if ancient Chinese have belief, they must believe in the god of nature. Their art, food, literatures are from the nature.  Nowadays, because of capitalization, Chinese pollute their motherland, poison their food. Pls remember your roots all from the god of the nature who provide you everything. 

李子柒（Li Ziqi）show us a whole new lifestyle comparing with the modern life. I believe that is so called 世外桃源 in Chinese, which means people live by themselves in a spectacular and isolating place, they r cultivating, planting, tailoring, crafting,etc. They dont have nationality. During the breaking days, they can draw and read. Isolating from the crowded world where full of judgement, resentment, jealousness, prejudice and some people who position themselves at a morally high ground to force you to do what they believe in that so called “freedom” ??

I saw some condemning reviews under the other Li’s video about she pushed her dog. The dog didnt get any hurt and some of reviewers just keep positioning themselves at the moral high ground to condemn her. Pls remember, when you r condemning at this, you hurt a person who  is a dog lover as well.
This is how we should’ve lived. Yes it’s not like a fancy place to live but just look at it, it’s peaceful. If I was her, I would have lived like her
이렇게 아름답고 고운분이 못하는게 없네요 그냥 매료가 되면서 보는게 참으로 아름답네요
seger bgt liatnya
Tuyệt quá : không bay nhẩy hoa mĩ như những bộ phim kiếm hiệp. Nhưng ý nghĩa hoạt cảnh đẹp của núi rừng núi mây sương tuyết và người con gái Trung Hoa ai xem cũng muốn trái tim nhảy ta khỏi lồng ngực. Quá tuyệt
Whst happens with the other Fruits and Vegetables.Did she sell them?otherwise it would be a waste
我很感动！但我不想说，因为宝宝心里苦：找不到恰当的词语来形容。这是本人看的第一个李子柒的視頻，居然看看哭了（声音没出来）： 美如仙境，虫鸣鸟叫，整个画面行云流水，宁静的生活像在世外桃源，又处处充满艺术般的诗情画意，背景音乐让一颗浮躁的心安静下来。好莱坞般摄影，及后期编辑之强大，足以荣膺，本年度油管制作之皇冠上的明珠！
That's what I really admire the Chinese culture they have a variety of food preservation! I want to live with a simple life in the foraging forest:-)
Ли Цзыци

又见满山红，
一颗颗小果子染遍了秋。
摘上一背篓涩柿子，
削皮 晾干
美味的吊柿饼今年就又有

Посмотри! Горы в красном убранстве;
Это крошечный плод так окрасила осень;
За плечами корзина с отборной терпкой хурмой;
Очисти и высуши,
И готово прекрасное сладкое лакомство этого года.
Прекрасно! Но почему я не вижу  в этом красивом месте насекомых,  как будто их там вообще нет.
I love persimmons!
柿源郷
我支持日本！
感动，让我想起了小时候在老家吃甜柿饼的日子

比任何电影，电视剧都好看，因为太过于真实，不是演戏，所以更加珍惜和反思，现在的我像大多数人一样喜欢奢侈品，别人有的我也想有，可是看了这个影片似乎真的能让人变得淡然，似乎世间真的太美好，不知是音乐的力量还是姑娘的魅力，一点一滴都在影响着太多人，这一切似乎又太奢侈！
the sweet of persimmons and the bitter of the hot tea is a very good combination. it's a perfect way to enjoy the winter.
Proud to be a Nature Lover 
Nice
Your videos remind my parents of their childhood in bhutan :) they like watching your videos very much
Madam I want your Street fruits....
嗨美丽！
我来自俄罗斯，我不小心偶然发现了你的视频，我喜欢你住在那里，大自然，浆果等等。
我自己从一个小村庄和一个贫穷的村庄没有这样的性质，我们在农场工作，我们的村庄很穷，居民也在这里。 我想说这个。
我是多么羡慕你，你和每个住在那里的人也是一个美丽的地方。 我想要的！
What fruit, herb,  veggie, animal does this village not have OMG! Beautiful paradise
0:42 she is eating like a baby.. 
Exceptionally adorable,,,  the reflection of innocence is incomparable!!!
I love persimmons ,she is so lucky to have and leave in this beautiful place
最純樸自然又美的小柒姑娘！我們認識快3年了！不知妳好過得好嗎？！說真心話妳可以來台灣屏東縣幫忙我照顧工廠嗎？我盼望著能再次出現見到妳？可否分享妳現在的狀況！我知道妳最近跟杭州微念！詐騙集團資源！子柒妳要自己掌控好妳的專利技術商標！徹底取回自己多年的努力！要堅持我挺妳子柒！好好珍惜！這段感情生活！我在台灣遠方傳來！見見面好好溝通聊聊近況如何？好嗎？不見不散？
Even Gordon Ramsay can’t top this
All life has it's rewards, Li, truly shows a non materialistic lifestyle, a down to earth simplistic caring for what she harvests for her and her elders. I love this woman's appreciation, respect, confidence, caring, harmony, natural beauty, compassion, love, attention to detail, she has won my heart, though we will never meet. Angel of the Orient, be yourself.
This is so amazing 
1:32 
子柒：“婆婆，这个是树上熟的”
婆婆：“这个红果像灯笼一样”
子柒：“稀耙（非常软），你吃嘛，抿甜（非常甜）
Ziqi:” Grandma, they are tree ripened”
Grandma:” look like Chinese lantern”
Ziqi:”very soft and sweet, just try it”
1:46
“你吃到还是很甜的哈？稀耙。这个天要是吹个风还是干的比较快噶”
” very sweet, isn’t it? So soft. If we have windy days they will get air dried quickly.”
영상이 너무 이뻐요♡
전부 거짓이라해도 너무 힐링된다 amazing liziqi 加油 頑張って
Nice
Wow,I've heard about her millions of time,but this is the first time I actually sit down and watch this. OMG, this is just so relaxing and wonderful.I guess from now on this will be in my dream forever. This reminds me how beautiful life could be!
Hola preciosa yutuber
God's gifts are abundance at her place...and she knows how to make use of them very well. At where i live I have to spend money for everything I eat. Would love to experience her lifestyle.
I think everything she makes is yummy and so pretty set on her table....
đúng là cô gái nghị lực và thật cảm xúc ️️️️
️️
She is just amazing , everything is available
சூப்பர் சமையல் பிராண்டு
每次视频快结束时的往期节目推荐遮挡的画面太多了，严重影响观看体验。即使要保留也应该缩小、并放到上方的角落而不是下方的关键位置。希望频道管理者能改善，谢谢！
大柿子是我的所愛，每次在超市里看見柿子餅都有買的衝動，有時候買成箱的新鮮柿子回家，我小女兒一下能吃好幾個。
너무 힘든 삶 ,  하지만 행복해 보여서  좋아아요. 자주 보고 있어요. 응원합니다.
awesome
A Forrest princess and a superior business woman! Much respect and love from an old lady princess in Florida in the USA.
Hello from Kurdistan you are Great ️️
美人で仕事も出来て、、都会のど真ん中でカッコつけてる自分が少し恥ずかしくなりました。

謝謝 我非常感謝迩 我日本人 
我尊重你和中国人
终于知道柿子饼是怎么做的了，谢谢! Finally I know and learn how to make the dried persimmon. thanks
Meanwhile the only way I can dry fruit is the oven.
is she buying those fruits? or no one own that area? I was wondering.. the mountains are blessed for having so much fruits and herbs
절경을 볼 때 마다 감탄이 절로...
산의 모습이 넘 멋있네요
날카로와져 있던 신경이 가라앉고
스트레스가 풀리는 느낌이예요
감사감사
The princess is in space ( no more explaining required (UO) do you want to go and talk to them ( you’re welcome  too ) when the earth start to move up  is better for brain talking ( no headaches is better ) trust me  is nice and peaceful
My life was like this when I was young in the Philippines.  I want to go back to that kind a life again.
Nice
身体にいい食事デスねー     針、仕事　布団　作り　可愛い洋服　んーーもっと見たいです。竹細工見事でした。(● ˃̶͈̀ロ˂̶͈́)੭ꠥ⁾⁾
日本語版　欲しいです。
看完我决定要叫小伙伴一起去摘柿子了 现在应该有好多熟透了
OMG I miss the persimmons so much I haven't tasted them for years
Hi your video is my favourite
Out of all her video, I love this one the most
พี่เค้าทำเก่งมาก
I want a get away from the society and live like this for a while. I’m so isolated and didn’t know how to pick myself back up.
Its like a meditation watching these videos. This is life far away from all rush and chaos of city life.
She’s so hard working lady, I love it
Super food
A sweet persimmon is one of my favorite fruits.

いいなーそこに住みたいですなー
看到这么多人喜欢你，让我想到，不管哪个国家哪个地方的人，大家追求的东西其实是一样的，美食、自然、宁静、和谐和美好。真让人感动。
不禁让人想起，千百年来 我们的祖先就是这么生活的！远离庙堂，远离争斗，这可能就是陶渊明笔下的天堂。
How long did they dry to form the sugar? I would love to visit there.
persimmons is my fav fruit and now it's not the season of them and i really want to eat them after watching this video  
Nice
Most of us here agree that it would be a dream to live her life, but let's not forget that what she has now is all the outcome of really hard work. This kind of life is not suitable for everyone because of the labor that comes with it. She is amazing. Let's not forget also how old she is (maybe 29 if I'm not mistaken). She is very young and capable of doing all of this.  It's like an ancient spirit reincarnated in the body of a young beautiful woman.
美丽的吊柿子窗帘。。
ああぁぁぁ〜〜

ため息でるくらい美しい
She is a breathe of fresh air.
I love this video. It reminds me of my hometown. Oh, I almost forgot I was grown in metro city and not even from china.
Love from Bangladesh
Шикарное видео!
Like a mistic fairytale... Unbelievable...
is that Heaven? 
I cant express how your videos make me feel.
I love to have one plant of this fruit.
HUMMMM YUMMY AGAIN
J adore votre style de vie
Happy Chinese New Year 

Daniel (Imran) From Wales, Britain 
谢谢子柒把生活中最美的一面展现出来，给人们以慰藉。其实四川的冬天是不舒服的，无处躲藏的冷啊
Лесная Фея, СПАСИБО за гармонию!!!
Note how granny cut the skin continuously... Thats some skill there
I love ️ this woman !!!
everything seems so peaceful uwu
Nice
할머니랑 같이 있는 모습 너무 좋아요
This fruit looks like a tomato pretending to be an apple
那个柿饼撕开的时候真的看上去好好吃。想念小时后可以经常吃到的柿饼！
这段视频，在配乐和意境上都特别好，雪花纷纷飘落，一壶茶独自品，太棒了
YOUR SUCH A BEAUTIFUL LADY VLOGGER
i also recommend u to watch her another vedio "纸墨笔砚"，maybe translated "paper and ink writing bush and ink stone".Li Ziqi paper a few years to make this vedio, she taked some great masters in China as teachers to learn how to make the best calligraphy tools. Some skills is very difficult, she is not only enjoy her life ,she is also enjoy the new kmowledge, she is still a persevering girl. i love her .
nice life 
I think heaven may be have like this place and peace...
Masya Allaah, luar biasa..
This girl is living a good  life. :D
Name of this fruit
Li Ziqi, you are amazing <3
What is the name of fruit
🇹🇼你好，我是來自臺灣的網友，很喜歡妳的頻道，請問妳會定期更新頻道嗎？🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼🇹🇼
Mana from heaven ! God bless this girl !
真棒看着就想吃
I think this has to be my new favorite channel. The colors in this video pop and the imagery is sharp and simply beautiful !!
I like persimmon they are so tasty! 
Just wondering....what happened with the rest of the fruits she didn't pick up, she just take as much as she needs. Normally other people will take all to sell in the market....but those plenty...abundantly....who cares?


So cute the way of peeling fruits between her and her grandma...just different!


So smart how she left a bit of stalk to be tied the fruits with string, then hang them like house decoration.
Nice
感谢李子柒把中国的文化传播到世界各地，今天才发现你是绵阳人，我也是绵阳人，为你感到自豪！
这真的是最爱的频道了，经常全家老小一起看，边看边想着遥远的祖国，有和我一样的吗？
You're videos are wonderful & beautiful. Even though there are no words ever spoken, it draws you in and transports you to another time and place. Unfortunately I live in a congested city with too many people, so this is a nice escape. Congratulations on your million subscribers. 
Many blessings to you and your family from Florida, USA.
I would love to live like her but realistically land is expensive and it would take a while to get started. The land and crops she has have been there for many years. Not gonna give up though!
Love your video and hardwork
Itx jss like heaven..wona live there for a while...aah
В каком чудесном месте вы живёте!

The videographer and the editor deserves so much credit for her videos. They’re the unsung heroes ️
مقطع مريح للروح
She's like a Goddess
Super mam
Even better steamed Cimmamon apples in the middle of a cake~
 my mouth is watering

I'm really proud to see a YouTuber like you who presents the beauty of Chinese culture through such a peaceful way
This whole concept reminds me of Stardew Valley ️
I love watching your videos. They are so meditative and relaxing. Thank you for sharing what you do!
До чего же богатая природа. Горный Тибет...
That's one lucky Grandma. Always respect your elders.

That is my favourite thing to do, fruit picking 
🇰🇭🇰🇭🇰🇭
I have no words to explain the feeling when I see your video. It direct conect me to the nature. Truly speechless. Keep posting such great videos.
好怀念，儿时的零食，现在超市已经买不到这么传统的口味的
Sound, angle, atmosphere everything is good!
Ngon  qúa o
