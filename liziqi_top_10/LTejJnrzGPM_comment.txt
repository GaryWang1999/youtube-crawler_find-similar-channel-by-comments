Bamboo is incredible.  Also, she's so skilled!  What an engineer!
Your videos are amazing, all of your videos I watch from start to finish, I hope you make more new videos, thank you
She is the strongest woman that I have ever seen with multi-skills from the engineer, landscaper, and chef. BIG love from me.❤🇮🇳
It's so sweet how she always asks her family members if it looks nice, and the family members always enthusiastically compliment her work.
不知看幾次這集了，讓我真心愛上她的一集視頻，哪個年輕漂亮的女孩兒有這麼俐落的手腳，作出這只有老老輩男人才作得出的竹製家具，第一次看到她作這些真的嚇歪了，且整個畫面環境背景這麼調和，賞心越目。太匪夷所思又讓人佩服的奇女子啊！

She is literally a strong, independent and a skillful woman. Each video make me more amazed and she inspires me into doing such stuff but I'm sure I'll continue doing nothing and just keep watching her videos.
this woman is the coolest person in the world no exceptions
can honestly not get enough of her videos.  she is super talented, from hand crafted furniture, self made make up and girl can cook!  she's literally somebody to idolise.
Acho  maravilhoso esse trabalho com bambu, e está moça está de parabéns!!
This video was sent to me over two and half years ago from a former boss. It didn't give credit to the woman or original website. But I recently came across LiZiqi's videos on YouTube. Love this young woman and her documentation of country living in China and how hard and industrious people have had to be out of necessity.
I LOVE YOU MORES.BABY

I hate when ppl reduce her only to a cooking channel. She's an engineer, a homemaker, the ultimate DIY channel imo
This was the 1st video of her that i saw 2 years ago, on 2019... And i fall in love of her instantly; so amazed and almost couldn't believe this lady can do these all but then i made this as a motivation to myself...i had to be strong and independent like her...not complain about how difficult and weak i am... so inspired...
O que essa mulher não sabe fazer? Ela é incrível 😍❤
Ficou maravilhoso 💙
I don't know why people hate this video, but this video makes you want to make more furniture! Thank you Liziqi for making this video! This video really helped all of us!!
Liziqi,s você e uma pessoa muito especial de um talento incomparável, amo seus trabalhos o jeito de cozinhar de plantar.

I struggle to put together IKEA’s simplest products and here is she doing everything from scratch.

Como me gusta ver a esta muchachita .sabe hacer de todo su huerta me encanta tiene de todo , gracias por compartir lo que sabes🙏
i'm pretty sure if social media wasn't a thing, then we would all be doing things like this, making things from scratch and learning new skills
the way she walked on the seat of the sofa to test its durability was adorable 💕
I wish I could do something like this. I love the way she makes things.

This was amazing and it was strangely calming to watch she is really cool and I love how she cared so much for her grandma
Que sonho esse sofá. Será que consigo fazer um?
What a beautiful engineer!  Your work is wonderful and your creations are awesome!!
Watched many times, but still come back times to view it again to gain peach of mind. Everything is just so beautiful and harmonious. Love the videos
Handsoff to your patience and hardwork... truly admirable... keep going 👍🏼
Sensacional, parabéns moça.
👏👏👏💐
Wow. This is like life goals for me here. This girl's a gorgeous, intelligent, disciplined, and skilled engineer. THIS GIRLS ON FIRE!! Keep it up. You gotta new subscriber!
Gorgeous furniture!!  I dream to have one. Lizyqi is a superstar. 
Beauty, knowledge, imagination, strength, she is like magician in her paradise.
Not to sound dramatic but being an artist and seeing her work until the sun came down , I cried,  I love how art can make us forget about everything around us and in the end that work created something really beautiful.
Можно бесконечно смотреть на огонь, воду и как другие работают! Вот настоящая семейная ценности! Всем бы такую женщину!
I love your videos so much, calm and enjoyable to watch,  the music are fantastic too.
I love how her fridge has a lot pf space because all of her ingredients are freshly outside .
I believe there’s a team behind her that makes her videos so successful. I grew up in village watching my mom can cut bamboos and sold them for money , I had also watched my grandfather making something out of bamboo. But what these videos presented to audiences only showed the most beautiful sides of living in villages, in reality, it’s not as beautiful like them. Cow poo , pig poo plus raining day in village made very dirty road, As a kid, I wanted to move away and live in the city Which I did living in city now . But one thing for sure , I grew up with some good childhood memories surrounded by  nature in village .
Muito lindo parabéns
Holy cow. 
Lumber work, wood work, carpentry, sewing, knitting, engineering all in one video.
Amazing 👏 you are really appreciable I have never found this much aesthetic, hardworking and sweet channel which always spread knowledge
The happiness I feel watching this .... In love with every small detail  in there
ojala yo viviera en china y ver un bosque tan hermoso como el de bambú  🌷
During this pandemic..i feel vids like these really help ease the stress
Bamboo is remarkable as much as the young lady is! It makes me see how much we have lost by not making things as we live  in this artificial prepackaged world. Humans worked this way for thousands of years, utilizing their hands with their brain.
She’s literally one of the most talented,creative,strong and inspiring women that I have ever seen a real superwomen🤗Love her❣️
Вот это женщина, цены нет ей! 👍
In the West, they’re surprised with various things she can do: sewing, knitting, cooking, building furniture, gardening, planting, arts and craft. All this things are taught in the public schools (home economics subject) in the Philippines from elementary - high school. I missed those years.
Ella es sorpréndete, me inspira demasiado aparte sus videos me dan tranquilidad y me hacen reflexionar.. es fabulosa. :3
This type of person is very self satisfy and fulfuling. Supertalented in all aspects. Rare to find such girl. She should be proud of herself and inspire us to improve a little at a time in whatever we do. No jealousy pls, should admire her talent irrespective of race. 💖💗💖
she’s really out here living the dream. wish i could live in a place as beautiful as that
Maravilha essa moça. Perfeição feminina. Uma Deusa.
You are just awesome. I have no other words for your talent 😊
As a woodworker myself, its interesting to see the way the same tecniques are utilized on such a different material to achieve a very flattering result. In particular, i liked the heat bending for the bamboo table.

It's all very simple, nothing particularly difficult. But these simple tecniques and materials are used to achieve a great result.
I believe there’s a team behind her that makes her videos so successful. I grew up in village watching my mom can cut bamboos and sold them for money , I had also watched my grandfather making something out of bamboo.

que hermoso trabajo uwu
Muy hermoso!🥰
Lindo! Parabéns! Bjs do Brasil
She is sooooo Amazing, I admire her so much she is so talented💜💜💜💜💜
Not only being a talented chef, carpenter, artist and so on,  Ziqi also demonstrated her bravery of conquering any difficulty with her bare hands, and in a skillful and graceful way. For kids living in cities nowadays, Ziqi is a precious role model for them.
Amazing as always!! Can’t wait for more 😍
Все красиво и виды и работа и изделия и девушка ... общее впечатление от увиденного - супер! Любить и на руках носить!
She's so talented and I really do admire and appreciate everything esp garden
Que precioso que arte tienes muchas bendiciones
Heres una niña muy hermosa en el buen sentido de la palabra, muy trabajadora, heres única, linda, me gusta mucho ver tus vídeos y he aprendido muchas cosas de ti, ya me suscribí a tu canal, muchas bendiciones por ser tan amorosa con tu abuelita, Jehova te bendiga siempre.
The way she works is just calming to the nerves.
Wow, bamboo is so useful and easy to work with compared to solid wood trees.
Lindo mesmo like 👍 perfeito amei parabéns Deus abençoe sempre sucesso 🙏😘❤️🌹
You can COOK, KNIT and BUILD! What else can you do???  You're TOTALLY AWESOME! Love you!!!!
Veo tus vídeos y me impresiona  cuanta creatividad . saludos
Maravilloso los muebles que hizo felicitaciones 🙏👌🌎🌴
Is there anything this woman can't do?? I'm so amazed by her talents and skills
Those are some beautifully honed crafting skills.
You can not buy something so beautiful and meaningful with money.
Very admirable.
All her movements are very quick and energetic, but incredibly precise. Amazing to watch a master at work.
She does ALL those things without breaking a sweat. And it’s amazing how a farm only needs a little attention to be productive, one day she is harvesting, another day making tea and dresses. Meanwhile the farm magically maintains itself. 🤣
Adoro seu trabalho, você é muito inteligente,pena que só falo português.
It astounds me though its for man's work still she can do it. So incredible! More cool  and awesome videos!
Talented, gifted and resourceful far beyond her years.  Awesome, so cool for those with a youthful, modern vocabulary.
Lindos trabalhos um talento especial
It is impressive! No workbench, no complex machinery, literally: "handmade"
What kind of creature could "not like" this?
This is really amazing 李子柒... Just want to go there and learn from you...非常好❤️
I saw her this video and i am seeing it again but i don't feel bored it's literally very nice😍.
Thank you liziqi for bringing peaceful videos where there are mountains and hills with birds singing in tidbits
Thank you so much for sharing this video it is so amazing 😍
She is an inspiration.... living example of wishdom and extraordinary skills
Okay this is the most wholesome channel I've ever seen. This is inspiring!
Wow! Beautiful bamboos! Love it so much. Greetings from Yogyakarta, Indonesia
You are pretty hardworking and creative. May God Blessed You and Your Family
Liziqi you are amazing! Congratulations on the videos and channel. The place where you live is beautiful! 😊
Incrível 👍👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Saludos desde México 🇲🇽 Hermosa ❤️
May your hands always be busy ,may your feet always be swift,and may you stay forever young.
WAAAA I am speechless!!!  She's amazing and she has the grit to build furnitures from scratch!!!
This is officially a therapy for me. Seeing a multi talented young woman like you fills me of joy. Good job! 👏👏👏👏👏
Thanking you for the beautiful nature based content. Just to say, in my newly released book, Re-imagining mathematics,  by Ashna Sen, I explore how the whole of mathematics can emerge from nature,  the arts and even community...exactly what you do!
我終於遇到了我遙遠而熱愛的傳統國家，在很長一段時間里，我也終於看到了我的願望❤️
4:21 Bamboo is such a versatile material. May her undying work ethic inspire us all.
It's a miracle...she does  each task skillfully.
Wah! Beautiful furnitures made. If I do even one of the many activities she does on a daily basis,my dad will die out of happiness.😂
The knowledge of knowing the characteristics of the wood and creativity is just astonishing.
Gente amo ver vcs trabalhar vcs são muito Caprisoso bjsss
Ficou muito top
she is so hardworking ♥️🔥🥺god bless her
Que hermoso trabajo...estoy anonadada que una mujer como tu haga todo esto..mis felicitaciones .. saludos desde México..

Does she ever get tired doing one thing after another? And she doesn't even sweat! She's amazing!
this video has the quality production of a drama on tv. lowkey was expecting some kinda story to happen. 


also this girl is hella talented wtf
How wonderful and resourceful you are you make everything look so easy , I’m so envious of your organic life and beautiful surroundings. I love all your pets and animals sooo cute.
Bamboo furniture is very popular at the moment in the uk.
Just out of interest do you have any predators where you live?
This looks so cool I wish I had that bamboo chair
Bamboo is amazing.
If it was discovered today, it would be called a high tech wonder material.
Happened to come across this by chance. This is just magical. She is doing wonders. From India with lots of love.
Hermoso 💚
Me: I need new sofa. Goes to IKEA
Her: I need new sofa. Goes to forest
she’s reminds me of myself strong, independent , creative and work from sun up to sun down . I’m a mom of 2 and work hard every single day
Such beautiful furniture and decor
Li Zi Qi, you are one of China's loveliest hidden treasures. An inspiration to women all over the world, an ambassador of Chinese art, culture, cuisine and way of life. Truly awe inspiring!
wow, so much hard-work ! & the finished pieces look stunning !
This is the only channel on Youtube (or anywhere) where I don't mind watching the same video a few times. I am scared one day I will watch all her video and there will be nothing left to watch lol.
Eating what u grow = amazing
Having tea on a freashly made bench made by you = next lvl
Watched it once a while ago watching it again because this is just so awesome,she's so talented
"I have been wanting to buy a sofa set but the desired ones typically cost over 10k RMB. Last week, I found the bamboo sofa set that my grandpa made a long time ago, so I decided to try to make a brand new set. Items made from bamboo around this season, for example, a back basket, a chair or a rack, would not form bugs. I have made a back basket, a folding fan, and a sweeper once, but never a sofa set. I made a lot of mistakes, fortunately, I managed to make an arhat bed, an empress chair and a tea table. I am extremely happy and have a big smile on my face since I just saved a ton of money."   
How cute :0
Cô ấy mạnh mẽ như 1 người đàn ông thật sự :3
Tôi rất thích quang cảnh thiên nhiên ở đây, nó đẹp và yên bình!
Czy jest coś czego ta dziewczyna nie umie zrobić, chyba nie. To wyjątkowo uzdolniona osoba i bardzo pracowita, aż miło na nią patrzeć. Dziękuję Ci za świetne filmy i pozdrawiam z dalekiego kraju.
好棒的生活！這些拍的製作手工，如果是真的姑娘自己完成的話，感覺這姑娘很可以啊！！可以娶回家了！！！
I knew bamboo was strong, but I didn’t know it was this strong.
Amazing! Natural furniture! Awesome!
Awww!! She's so hard working and loving to her grandma 😢💕
What a goddess!! Everything she touched turns to Gold.
谢谢李子柒带给我们的文化传统视觉盛宴
She is strong and beautiful lady in all of china I believe. She is engineer, handcraft expert , cook what a personality.
You are very talented and you can show all the great traditions and culture of China.
Hello, love your videos...😊

Wanted to know what material you used for fill up the cushions please ? 🙏
She heated and bent the bamboo
Me: WHOA! 😮
Totally learned something new today 😊
Can’t believe she lives in the next province I lived in China before! Such an inspiring way of living!
Добрый день милая девушка!!! Красавица такая! Ещё и трудолюбивая! Дай БОГ тебе здоровья и всем твоим родным!!!
looking at your bunch of works reminds me working harder, what a incredible girl you are
Sabe, não importa se vocês não me entenderem kkkk, eu quero dizer que eu adorei o trabalho, curti a música, e isso fez eu me sentir bem, 💓
She's so creative ❤
Madam, I'm both humbled and hypnotized by your skill, craftsmanship, art and beauty.
meu avô tendeu gosta mt de seus vídeos, ele gostaria de saber quanto tempo leva para terminar?
Really  your the great follower of tune of the nature🌿🍃, when I was watching your videos I would be live like you, and make some more videos please
i spent years trying to find her youtube and i finally found it 😂
She is multi-talented god bless you dear ❤️
Wow! Amazing beautiful work on the furniture and she made beautiful pillows and cushions! Most young girls here in the U.S.A. Can’t even cook! They are too busy glued to their phones.
I need a bamboo forest with some foggy atmosphere.
And sunflowers.
Definitely
Tudo na base do bamboo 😍👌
Watching this video I saw elegance in her movement as she cut through, bent, and shaped the bamboo is so many ways...but with her elegance there was a sense of strength and hard work put into the making of the furniture. Watching this calmed me and I felt a sense of relax. I love this video, and I love how you made it with only bamboo and other utensils.☺️😊
Another excellent project and looks fantastic and very clever and very skilled lady. Thank you 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
She is very focused person ,such a disciple if everyone get then don't know where we will be ..
Superb you are truly inspiration for those people who says their is not facilities in village ,we can't lead a good life there but you prove them wrong ,you can lead z even better life their .....
Perfeito
This is what i wanted. I want to live my life like this . May god fulfill my wish ❤
This reminds me pf my grandpa making a bamboo bed and also of the times we visited the province during summer vacation.
She is making furniture the traditional way. I am glad I had a chance to watch her video, it's a fast food age and people forgotten the true beauty our ancestors left behind
Toujours aussi joli des mains de fée et un résultat superbe😘
You are now my inspiration to do anything i want :)
That place is like paradise on earth. She is simple and so beautiful and very talented.
Que moça habilidosa!!!
I wish I found this kind of woman ❤️ very talented
This is soo calming and soothing . Its like getting stress-free . God; this girl is super talented

Words cannot express how happy I was to find this beautiful channel. My mother died last week totally unexpectedly and watching your videos is cleansing my soul. Thank you from the bottom of my heart x
When you buy a new furniture in ikea and you need to assemble and keep complaining what’s next. And her she is doing her own furniture in scratch ♥️♥️♥️
This lady is my hero, she makes so many amazing things I never thought possible even as a craftsperson myself
The work she does  all are ecofriendly.
this never fails to make me at peace
Amazing.  Creative, talented, industrious, unassuming and beautiful.
Watching this woman work is very relaxing.
李子柒真棒！太欣賞她了！
Wow the atmosphere is amazing and beautiful. All the flowers and trees 😊
Molto bello e creativo! Grazie per aver condiviso🌸
The way she handles the instrument s of carpentry it's not fake, everything by practice only.hats off.by seeing her whatever I'm not doing, now started again.🙏
I would love try doing the same, but there is no bamboo forest where i live 😣 i don't have enough strength to build with wood so bamboo was perfect☹️
Wauu que belleza desde el Ecuador  saludos y muchas bendiciones
Красавица, трудоголик, с изумительным вкусом.
You're very talented! Very calming video. Great to see resourceful craftsmanship. Thanks for sharing
Amazing skill all done, and all my respect 🙌
Thật sự mà nói, cháu rất là giỏi, thật tuyệt vời 👍❤❤❤
You and your making furniture both are  gorgeous
Bom dia..seu trabalho é muito bonito..
Eu também sou artesão no Brasil.
This was my first video of Liziqi.  I have been a super fan since.
this inspired me to do my home work and apply for jobs (i have social anxiety and have quit jobs due to anxiety). this makes me feel like i do nothing all day, i should be making furniture for my grandparents
说句官式的真心话，子柒真的是中国人优秀品质的集大成者。
I was like: "how will she bring these bamboos home?"
And  then she freaking dragged those damn bamboos home 😵 she is so amazing
There's something so serene and beautiful about the way she work
She is the best woman!!! i always watching!!! her abilities are truly amazing.
Лизи  какая ты молодец на все руки мастер Молодец
muy buen trabajo
Bamboo is so EASY to carve...

I could make a Flute out of Bamboo, haha :)
Every move she makes is dripping in confidence
At first I was jealous because of all the cool things she can do and build and all the knowledge she must possess but I realize it’s her confidence and sureness I wish I had
She’s amazing
Wonder women 💪

En etkilendigim bolumlerinden biri maşallah Allah ne el becerisi vermis bu kiza ya bildigin bambudan oturma grubu yapti 😃😃
Как только высохнет бамбук вся конструкция рассохнется и распадётся... неделя максимум. А так красиво, да и девушка красивая занята делом - можно бесконечно смотреть.
This lady is amazing. She does so many things 24/7 and never even breaks a sweat.

儿时的回忆，我家也有这个竹子床，子柒厉害👍
Masya Allah...amazing❤️
Is there anything that this amazing young lady does NOT know how to do?? I am in awe.
Me: Doctor, there are something wrong with me
Doctor: What seems to be wrong
Me: I cant stop watching Liziqi's Videos
Doctor: Me too
One of my favorite videos ❤❤
When I saw the thumbnail few days ago in my recommendations, I thought maybe its some sort of short clips of drama videos so never clicked. I wasn't expecting this... She is so cool...
子柒做的家具很漂亮！❤️❤️❤️❤️💕
Смотреть такие чудесные видео даже если мы понимаем, что они постановочные всегда очень хочется и они необходимы в наш век, где технологии заменили обычный физический труд и людям лень , что-либо сделать полезное своими руками, так как они у них все в маникюрах и ботоксах, труд и только труд сделал из обезьяны человека и это не фигура речи.
Inteligência parabéns
Your so strong to pick those bunch of bamboos ☺️
Есть что то, что эта девушка не умеет?! На все руки мастер!
Ikea: We make the best furniture in the world.
Liziqi: Hold my Bamboo!
I love this girl. She is so smart and very independent.
What a phenomenal woman wish I was half as talented
Me: A 2nd year engineering student thinking my 3D printed lego car toy was cool
Also me watching this video: 👁👄👁

I miss yours videos. 🥺🥺🥺
Please, come back with they soon. 👏
My best wishes!!!
Very strong lady lifting that bamboo like that as well as very clever lady making that beautiful furnitute!
Wow me impresiono su fuerza
After watching several of her videos, I am very much convinced that there is nothing this woman can't do
Dear @Liziqi where can I get knives like yours? I spend much time cooking and building as you do, such knives would be so useful to me! I really would like to know, I would buy some if I can
Okay, now I know what self-sufficient means. This woman is incredible!
Мое искреннее уважение!!!
Beautiful work!
Those bamboo forest are pretty, but our Liziqi is beautiful!
Beautiful place 🌾 Beautiful Lady🌹 who ever does your camera 📽 work has a real talent......
So Beautiful Art & Nature 🎍🌄👍
I saw an interview with her where she mentioned that her grandfather made furniture and taught her all about it when she was younger. It's wonderful to see that she keeps the tradition.
It takes me a while just to assemble one of my Ikea furniture meanwhile she creates new furnitures from scratch 😳
Lisiqi will live like a queen even if she left alone in this earth. Wanna meet u once. 
ഒരുപാട് ഇഷ്ടം ( lots of love❤️❤️❤️)
So beautiful furniture !!!
No words about her ❤
Beautiful sewing skills
I am a Hawaiian born Japanese woman who practices traditional Chinese medicine and you have once again made me fall in love with Chinese culture!  

I didn’t know mugwort could be used as a filler for cushions!  I wonder how it must smell.  I also loved the technique you used to bend bamboo.  It looks beautiful in its green state, but I’m guessing it will age into a nice beige color.  

It totally looked as if you had done this before.  Your tools were so specific and your movements were so deliberate and efficient!
Большая умничка ☺😊
这真的是最爱的频道了，经常全家老小一起看，边看边想着遥远的祖国，有和我一样的吗？
Beautiful and talented. What an inspiration. I love it all ❤❤❤❤🌻🌻🌻.
Respect nd love from India 🇮🇳
李子柒太强了，不但心灵手巧，连繁重的体力活也能干。👍👍
i am thoroughly convinced she is a forest spirit living with an old tree spirit
She's a Jack of All Trades and Master of all 😘😘😘.... Really admired this lady
Her and her grandmother are so precious I’m gonna cry. 

Also she is so gorgeous wtf how??
Wow! The things humans can do if they just get off technology, and live as God intended.
She's amazing ❤️
God bless you sister  what a beautiful nature
I used to sleep topless on bamboo beds as a kid, I remember it always pinching my skin, but it doesn't really get hot as much so it's great for when it's hot
When I think about how capable some people I know are….. face palm
Here's the translation:
I have been wanting to buy a sofa set but a good eye catching set costs over 10k RMB. Then last week I remembered my grandpa made a sofa set before. So I took his idea and try to make it. This is bamboo season, ideal to use to make a back basket, a chair and a rack and will not get infested with bugs. I made a back basket, a folding fan and a tray before but never made a sofa set. I made a lot of mistakes but with trial and error I finally made a monk bed, an empress chair and a tea table. Very happy, very happy. Coming from a smilely person who just saved a ton of money.
يعجبني كيف أنها تعتمد على نفسها...لا تحتاج أحدا !
رائعة♡
How do you keep the bamboo from molding or rotting?
Lets be honest guys. We all dream having HER as a wife. :D
Love love good food, love the environment, love our life, live a peaceful and happy life.
this women and those 2 guys who build mud houses in the woods should Collab !
Bamboo is like the Ikea of nature
I love this! She’s so hardworking and beautiful!
Cette femme est juste incroyable 🤩🤩🤩🤩 waaaw
Это просто бомба, я даже не верю что это она сделала
неужели эта хрупкая девушка сделала своими руками молодец   честь и хвала ей
Hat's off to your hard work
She is the most impressive person I have ever seen.
That's amazing ❤️❤️❤️
She’s so breathtakingly beautiful, one half of my family comes from her province. The south all along the Yangtze is so beautiful too, having grown up in the northwest corner near the border of Kazakhstan, I really wish I grew up here instead.
You are amazing & god gifted girl 🧡
Just amazing.  I am inspired by her very much
A 6 minutes video cost maybe a month to make, respect 👏

Hatsoff to this lady 🌟
Tell me, please, what liquid agent did you use to cover the bamboo trunks ? Please tell us in detail
She’s a very independent woman 
And she has lots of brains
Ikea: I can make all these furnitures 
People: This is unique hand made by Li ziqi unique girl from the world.no copies 😊
One of the most competent women I've ever seen! Hats off!
her: cutting down hard bamboo stalks
me: mom i cant cut this carrot
I love that she doesn't talk and try to explain everything. The silence adds to the power of these videos. Everyone around the world can just watch, learn and enjoy from this brilliant woman Li ZiQi.
Astounding to watch her skills
All that lovely hard work so she could enjoy tea with her grandma ♡
You are a very impressive person. So creative
Мало верится в её способности )
Hello liziqui I am from india🇳🇪🇳🇪🇳🇪 and we saw you in indian need channel you are amazing keep going👍👏👏👏👏
Liziqi: I’m not as strong as you

IKEA: No, you’re stronger
Hermoso,hermoso
Her videos make me want to drop everything,  move to rural China and make my own everything
I love this girl she so strong 🥺
Beautiful art!!! Lovely...
Здраствуйте,вы такая молодец.Смотрю все серии,хочу посадить бамбук у себя дома.пришлите мне немного семян,пожалуйста.😃
She is very very interesting and also amazing. Great women.
I mean, it is really great to watch. It's kind of relaxing and so on. But such a great unreal world, with a great actress.  a nice mini-movie chinese-anime style- I can say
Her videos were introduced by my kids' Chinese teacher. When my kid showed me this video, I told my kids, "nah, do you really believe on that?" Well,  weeks later, as I became addicted to those videos myself, I believe more and more her talent and strength. I truly appreciate that there are still such pure and peaceful minds out there, to inspire all generations.
It is too beautiful. 💕
So beautiful work😍
Hard work never fails
Le tout assemblé à l'aide de cheville "maison", un joli design. Pas besoin d'aller chez un marchand de meubles "scandinave" ou le tout est dans un carton ; Mes respects Madame.
wow, this was awesome to watch. love it
She reminds me of a character from some Ghibli movie, disciplined and focused, living in a beautiful environment.
Impresionante lo k hace  la muchacha
Ni hao!You're so amazing young girl with multiple talents!So inspiring! I'm learning from you much!
I just loved it... awesome.. superb... amazing... wow... mind-blowing ...
bon boulot ! bravo !
Hola preciosa buenos días eres increíble y inteligente y muy hermosa
It's a interesting lifestyle she has. She makes stuff from the things she finds, a very Eco friendly way of living. I wouldn't pull it off. Respect.
Liziqi is a role-model for anyone. She makes you fall in love with her culture. She represents women beauty in an inspiring way! 

I can't even imaging to watch that  Hollywood Celebrities n what they represent after these videos. 

Liziqi 🌿vs Cardi-B, Kardashians, Lady Caga,  Beyonce,ect ...! 🤳🤳🤳🥱
No glue. No nails or screws.

Still, she seems to achieve perfection.

This is probably the most beautiful thing I'm going to see today!!
O_O
Your videos are soo loving😍😍😍
Даже не верится что так бывает! Что то из области фантастики!
Salute to our superlady🔥love from India ❤️
Just how talented is she?
Beautiful and has many skills. Incredible
I'm stunned that she casually went out, grabbed some bamboo from the forest and then made this 😲🤯
You inspire every women in all ways❤️God bless you🌹
Not tightening everything until it's almost done looks like it's key.
She is too good to be a human being
Never seen or meet such a talented lady
the whole time i was imagining me and my crush living there and me making all this for her
During interview,
Boss: So what can you do 
Ziqi: Yes.
I EVEN SEARCH THIS BECAUSE ITS SO RELAXING AND ARTISTIC
Is there anything she can't do? Amazing.
Some great editing!
awww i always miss my grandma🥺 i grew up with her, she's literally my mom ever since, she treats me like her own daughter, but she passed away dec.3,2020 :<

I've been watching your vids quite some time right now and girl... You're so calming and you carried those bamboos and I'm like "ohh, of course she does that". And this life is exactly what I wish for. So peaceful.. Like I can sense positive energy from you to where I am now. Like DIYs with nature, this connection of mind and soul thing is soooo calming. Thanks for this vid!!
She is really very strong women! ❤
She’s so gorgeous and the way she works just captivates me. ✨✨
This woman has many talents, respectfully.
She's a very cleaver woman well done proud grandma
Parabéns

Ohh wow amazing ... very creative skills i love your channel love from Macau.
Those dislikes are from expensive, poorly made furniture shops
Как жаль,что у нас бамбук не растёт,я бы тоже столько смастерила б из него...
5:10   I wish I would've known about this technique when I was a young fort builder in the woods.
مرأة بمليون رجل ♥️

esta chica es perfecta habra algo no sepa hacer
Wow amazing.. Thank you for sharing..😘
It would be even more interesting to see the behind the scenes to see what it takes to make everything look so simple. I'm sure there's a whole production crew and a wardrobe department...
YouTube: Here, watch this cute Chinese woman build bamboo furniture.
Me: ...Ok
Read her story from online.
Her parents passed away when she was a kid. She was raised by her grandparents in rural countryside. Her grandpa passed away when she was 14. Her grandma didn't have enough money to raise her. So, she left home to look for jobs. 8 years after, her grandma was sick. She moved back home to take care of her grandma...

Tried many things, she discovered a way for living by making videos and food blogger. 

Her success is not only her talents, but also she courage and spirit - never give up!!

Only a person who truly love life can make such beautiful artistic pieces.
Commenting to help boost her channel, I hope you win your right back and are able to start creating content again.. Fighting!!!!
Wow.. just a few minutes in and I'm already captivated.. this is beautiful. I love YouTube
Now that is the sort of girl you need. Fantastic skills
Good job as always liz
대단하네요 저런곳에서 살고 싶다
I don't know why I watch stuff like this, I guess because its peaceful to me, and it brings peace to mind.  The music, her  Surroundings. The flowers, and the work she put into The furniture. 😊 is  Relaxing
Uma deusa luminosa!
Wow, how beautiful. Amazing skills. I love that it's all natural even the cushion stuffing
Wow I liked the furniture . Very pleasant
Amazing ❤️
Pause at 4:02 and you get yourself a killer screen background!
Hats off you liziqi 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Awesome! Thanks for sharing
She can be a carpenter, designer, dress maker, make up producer, farmer, and chef all at the same time😍😍
عمل رائع... لا أستغرب مقدرتك على فعل ذلك فجدتي كانت تقوم بأعمال معقدة حتى أنها لم تمتلك أدوات بسيطة تعينها على ذلك... فكانت تخيط الملابس وتنسج السجاد وتحصد القمح وتحلب الماعز وتصنع اللبن والسمن كانت تقوم بالكثير الكثير... النساء العربيات يمتلكن مهارات عديدة أيضا
It's awesome!👏
Grandma is lucky ✨💜
สุดยอดจริงเลยค่ะฉันไม่เคย
เห็นผู้หญิงที่เก่งเหมือนคุณ
มาก่อนทำได้ทุกอย่างทำอา
หารก็เก่งมากๆสุดยอดๆชอบ
คุณมากเลยค่ะ
You are very brave 💪💪💪💪 . All girl should be like you 😘😘😘
She’s so gorgeous, yet super skilled! She made me question my life. I’m a nerd - 24/7 behind a computer, so this is a new world to me 
haha

Amazing skills,  a very beautiful gir is so strong and very talented,  good job

When society collapses, this lady and her family will be living the high life
You are so amazing!
Wonderful 😍👌
優秀，美麗，能夠做任何事情。
淚了， 生活就是简单， 太爱了 😭😭😭
Hi I luv your cooking channel on you tube and also I luv your master carpentry in building bamboo furniture. Your are more than a cook, carpenter and maybe a w... What is your name in English sorry I cant read Chinese. My name is A Thanh from the United States
Women like her should be on cover of magazines
احترامي من الجزائر 🇩🇿👌🏻💪🏻
Respect for you sister
I cannot remember how many times I have watched this video.
her videos made me think of: what can men do that women cannot do? 👏👏👏
С такой девушкой даже на войну пойти не страшно!)))
好久好久沒有看到子柒姑娘你的視頻，真的好想念你，最近可好，奶奶和你都平安吧！
She can make furniture, clothes, food, and stay beautiful. Forget Super Woman she should be what girls aspire to be like. Amazing, she's just amazing.
너무나 아름다운 영상입니다. 한국을 좋아해주셔서 고맙습니다
This is the first video I saw of her..and I haven't been able to stop.....her world is a paradise.. because she lives in it.
我们写关于“文化”的高考作文的时候都是用李子柒姐姐来做事例的
Beautiful 😍
I am looking for Moso bamboo seeds. Would you please suggest to me a trustworthy supplier? It will be helpful for me.
Sungguh luar biasa Kaka sukses selalu.
OMG, how nice👌👍❤️
You're a genius.

God give you and your grandmother a long life.
Amazing work
She is amazing!!
Beautiful bamboo forest
Perfect bahu ❤️ you know everything
Girl power to the highest level! 🤩
these videos are honestly the solution to my stress
أنت رائعة، مبدعة، الله يحميك، بحبك كتير لأنك بتعطيني تفاؤل كبير، بس اتفرج على فيديوهاتك برتاح وبستمتع كلشي بتعمليه رائع جدا.
Seeing her is like hearing Bach. Everything fit, made from an idea in her mind in front of me, while I just look the unknown.
Good job,   ❤❤❤
She is  very talented in every thing
Extremely impressed
Lessons from Liziqi: 
1. Focus (no distractions)
2. Determination (following through till the end however long it takes)
3. Working closely and in line with nature.
4. Being occupied.
5. Learning new skills.
Result: mental peace (no anxiety/depression) and a joyful life.

Thank you for your contribution to humanity 💐.
So talented, and so adorable.💯
Leñadora, carpintera, modista... ¿Hay algo quw esta mujer no pueda hacer? Excelente trabajo!!
So something I've noticed is that in addition to just being resourceful and well-versed in rural life, she's also really smart. I know homesteaders and even my rural and farming ancestors who wouldn't be able to retain some of the information she's shown just on her youtube channel. Some of that comes from being raised in a rural area, but some of the things she does, well...I had a great-grandfather who knew about 100 different ways to cook potatoes due to those being the only surviving crops at one point, but other than that...
You are very good at all things.....👏👏🤩🥰
Love from the Philippines 🇵🇭😍❤️
Really wowed.....❤️❤️❤️
Good working and skill 👍👍
goes to forest
cuts bamboo
makes dam furniture
embroiders the pillows herself

WHAT CANT SHE DO
What a girl! I'm amazed! She is so gorgeous and strong
Cảnh thật đẹp
You r amazing 👏😘
OMG I just wanna say ...Amaziiinggggg ❤️❤️❤️🇮🇩
You are really amazing.
She is living a life which I always dream for. Living with nature is beautiful & Inspiring.  🥰🙏🍀🌷🍭
Bamboo is more the gold, unfortunately we miss it in our region.☹️☹️☹️
Very impressive. Li ziqi is really a wonderful.and capable  lady .
Vc é um amor😍😍
I just learned so much, thank you!
Very nice ma'am 🙏🙏
I’m speechless. I appreciate and respect this woman wholeheartedly.
talented lady, inspiring
这视频让我想起了我外公，他是一个木匠，我小时候也看过他用墨绳画线，用竹子做凉椅凉床。现在外公老了，做不了了，但是家里的很多他做的家具都还在
Girl power you go girl 🙏🏾💯
Ziqi you are so talented
Nice work 👌👌💓💓💓💓
Как на этом видео люди могли поставит👎🏻? Это же настоящий шедевр.
You are just made of skills
The video is perfect in everyway. How the video is shot not only capturing her talent but also the beautiful nature surrounding her. The background music is soo relaxing along with the sound of tool it's almost like an ASMR video 10/10
What a women. May Buddha always bless you and your loved ones.
RẤT ĐẸP, VÀ THẬT TUYỆT VỜI BẠN Ạ
U are so beautiful and creative.
I carried bamboos when I used to live in the hinterlands. Those are heavy and itchy
The quality of the video damn! I feel like am watching a movie
IKEA: We have all your furniture needs!
LiZiqi: Hold my bamboo 

IKEA has left the chat
这发展了我的童年，所以我仍然非常担心 (ʘᴗʘ✿)
A wonderful role model for all.
I love to see your video in morning 🙂
U r awesome, no words to moreee
생활력 대단하다
My brain: ill go early to sleep tonight

Me at 3am: building sophisticated old furniture from bamboo
She's so amasing❤❤❤
I bet her grandma was same level talented and beautiful 50 years ago.
Amazing👍
音が心地いい。とても綺麗。ありがとうございます。
HOW MANY INTERNATIONAL FANS ARE HERE FOR LIZIQI ??
I loved it hard work...girl power👌👌
Wow amazing 🤗🤗
Amazingly beautiful place and really pretty girl doing incerdible stuff. Feels like another world.
Wow she is just amazing.
Черт возьми...она все умеет,а вопрос:кто ее научил всему этому???🤔🤔
Too perfect👍
Harika 🙌
Really  u r very talented lady
With this lighting, music, and production quality you could’ve made a mid-budget K-drama but you had to pull a 180 on us and make a fricking sofa out of scratch. 10/10 excellent video.
时隔好久再来看真是太美了
OMG....she is so so talented girl & beautiful. 🥰🥰✌️
The only three words in my mind during the whole video:
"please marry me"
I'm a girl but i don't care, just marry me 😾
Just waaaow beautiful🔥❤️👍
Like for this girl hardworking ♥️👍
I almost cry. I remember that my family had a bamboo sofa just like the one that Li Ziqi made when I was a kid. I loved it very much and it was so cool and refreshing to sleep on. With the development of technology and economy (in China), we did not need it anymore since we've had air conditioners and fans everywhere, so one day (when it was 12 years ago or so) my granny decided to throw it away. I cried and begged her not to do that. She asked me:"How would you deal with this big thing? It takes up too much space." I didn't know how to answer her. She threw it away two days later... I will always remember the bamboo sofa that accompanied my family for decades, and all the precious things disappeared in the modern society.
I'm in love with this girl ❤😍
Watching your videos makes me want to become a better person...
You are multi-talented woman..loved all your videos Ziqi😘😘😘
Esa es una vida feliz
Tuyệt vời!
Wonderful! China, Japo and Koreas, the most intelligent races.
Que bonito!, China y paises Asiaticos , la raza más inteligente.
Que maravilha! China, Japão e Coréias, as raças mais inteligentes.
If there is a list of people who earth love she will be one among them
See. It does exist. Femininity, physicality, and master craftsmanship. True beauty.
imagine if all women were as competent and independent as her...
She is the definition of what it means to be a beautiful, strong, and independent women. Unlike these feminists here in the west.
U have to cure bamboo otherwise itll start to rot and break apart
Какая умница
We want your home and garden tour please
How many skills she has? 
She can be a cook, Taylor and she can make a furniture. 
Plus she seems never get tired and physically strong 😅
Liziqi é muito  talentosa !
Look forward to her own furniture line, Lizikea
Lý tử thất! Bạn rất giỏi!!!!!
sukaaa bangettt😍😍
so good  you are realy vary talented
It’s so beautiful. I’m too lazy to even do my dishes, but you’re making your own furniture!!
вот что бывает когда в доме нет мужика!!😊
I really don’t understand why people would dislike this ??
Perfect free renewable material, which when old can be discarded anywhere and it will simply turn into food for other plants. Still we somehow prefer using the nasty plastics...
very beautiful your work
If all people are learning and living a full joyful life like her. There should be no war in Ukarian and in the world. Ha ha!.
Multi talented woman 😯🙌
Wow it's just amazing 😲😲😲😲
"OK" this lady has some serious skills up her sleeve, many generations of knowledge and hard labour passed down through family to end up with this beautiful garden of eden,I hope she has children to pass this priceless knowledge to next generation.
Brilliant!
Suka bgt kreatip serba bisa.
How can i get my hands on the tools set in the video?
Beautiful ❤️❤️❤️❤️
第一次看七姐的视频，我天这就是我小时候睡的床啊。只不过我家买的还多了一个花纹，而且是黄色的。
she deserves more fame than all the celebrities and instagrammers chasing after it.
Isn't she a complete package 😱
Liziqi moves effortlessly with the Tao...
Great❤️❤️❤️
這集看完就是嚇死了!!!!~~~怎麼能一個人做出這些東東??!!!~~手藝簡直是出神入化~~第一 次知道竹子在他手中的延展性和伸縮性都超強!~~完全不是硬梆梆的舊有印象!
これ程の技術をどこで習得したのでしょうか⁉️凄いとしか言いようが、ありません🍒
She is the perfect definition of a strong independent woman.
All that hard work and her hands look so soft. How is that even possible. Amazing young women.
I like how this was randomly in my recommended box, thanks YouTube
What happens when the bamboo dries, all the imprecise cuts and perforations will trigger it to break, very nice, self-supporting, but it is just that, a beautiful and infunctional armchair.
now the only thing missing are some cute pandas and you're all set
Так успокаивает
I expected to see thirsty boys gushing over about what they'd like to do to her; I'm amazed and very, very happy to see so much respect!
I Want This Bamboo tress
I just read your story. It is hard to not give up after so much troubles.

You are inspiring and so are the surroundings. It truely is heaven.

The hardwork you put, the skills you have earned, your love towards your grandma (hope she is well now)....I have no words.

Keep making these videos. 
Sending love and support 🌹
all i can do when watch this video is stunned 😯
I wouldn't dare mess with her😩. With the strength she possesses
3:45 was a cute moment haha
Beautiful creatures
Woww you r just amazing. 👍
GENUINELY one of the most fascinating things i’ve ever watched.
she is really inspired me
How long does furniture like this normally last?
Very nice 👍
Much respect
Fact: you even can’t pay attention on reading comments while watching her videos
How could anyone dislike this video? It's absolutely lovely.
Gila, multitalenta❤️
Bear Grylls: I can survival in this forest for a month. 

Liziqi: hold on, let me build a city here.
Mb nya jago dalam bidang apapun 😭💔
А в России так быстро строительный лес не растет. 50-80 лет каждой ели  и сосне. Даже сушняк упавший, одной женщине из леса не вынести. Завидую вам . Тростник очень хороший материал, и лёгкий, и растет быстро.  За небольшое время и мебель, и забор готов.    Труд на пользу! Так у нас говорят.而在俄罗斯，建设森林不会增长这么快。 每棵云杉和松树都有50-80年的树龄。 即使是已经倒下的干燥杂草，一个女人也无法将其从森林中取出。 我羡慕你 芦苇是非常好的材料，和光，并迅速增长。 在很短的时间内，家具和围栏都准备好了。 为利益而工作！ 这就是我们说的。
Amazing 😍😎👍👍👍
Whenever I hear comments, from anybody, about women not being good enough or blablabla, I always think about this video, and I know they are wrong. This lady it's incredibly smart it's truly inspiring.
Is she someone from the past? Travel from time machine. Amazing.
素敵！雰囲気もすごく好き

I live in Japan, however
I can rarely see such a beautiful environment.

Why? Both countries locate
in same Asia.

Anyway, I wanna live such a
beautiful place!
I wish I was a quater of a third half as beautiful as you are.

Thank you for giving me purpose.

Liziqi channel, Вы мастер, но... объясните, какого черта у вас молоток ржавый весь... Вы что, храните его в курятнике? ) Почему вы колотите им по инструментам для работы по дереву?! Почему не пользуетесь деревянной киянкой... Если в вашей местности нет дерева, то наверняка можно сделать/купить пластиковую (из полипропилена например). Интернет есть, свет есть, значит не в таких уж дебрях живете. ))
Pokoknya keren Bos, saya pingin belajar ah..
Keren bgt gileee😭
i cant properly put together an ikea furniture with a manual

You r amazing
Talented and beautiful woman. I found happiness just watching this.
waaaaaah, how i wish i had that strength and skills, you're a genius
OMG How strong she is..
I have personally experienced cutting and lifting these bamboo trees. Although  those trees look thin and light, truely it is not. Those are very heavy, strong and cannot control due to its easticity.. 
I was really surprised by seeing she is lifting 5 or 6 full bamboo trees.. OMG.... it might be the power of her healthy foods.
GOOD LUCK
طبعا احب هيج أماكن 😍😍😍😍
ธรรมชาติของวิถีน่ามองเสมอ  /  อย่าละทิ้งสิ่งเหล่านี้นะครับ  เป็นกำลังใจให้เสมอ
She just needs those long@ss bamboo stems to make these furnitures which can be displayed in art exhibits
Süperrrrrrrrr 👍👍👍💋💋💋

I heard from her older fans that before she did these type of calm-country-life videos she made woodworking/handicraft tutorial videos and honestly I belive them
❤️❤️Very nice 😍😍❤️❤️
This video was amazing showing how this young lady built furniture,everything built by hand using fresh bamboo poles from the forest.
No money,or electric tools was used to purchase materials or building of the furniture.
Very talented young lady.👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏.
Thank you for sharing.
Greeding from the USA 🇺🇸 
Great job!!.

She is a cooker, carpenter, farmer,  contraktor, as well as grandma's bebysiter😁😍
I always watch your vlog for your creative and innovative ideas. And I recommend everyone to watch and make use of every available things for our needy and not to waste it.❤️
Bringing bamboos from hilly areas without any vehicle is really hard task. She is very strong.
Very nice 👌
Liziqi how does one visit your place and learn about the handicrafts? It would benefit many other communities. Thank you so much for sharing your amazing, beautiful heritage. Truly hope your sanctuary remains peaceful, secure and unpolluted and that you continue to keep it intact and protected for the future.
It’s amazing
Me: can't even do my homework
Liziqi: makes a furniture
Muito criativa essa moça. Parabéns.
That plant is a bless, specially for DIYers. We wish Bamboo grew all around the world. 👍😎
The best maker in the world
This is amazing! I hope to make something beautiful one day from the bamboo we planted 3 years ago.
Super 👌👌
Was expecting her to fly through the bamboo forest on the way back.
Criação fantástica!!
Vc nos ensinando sempre, Liziqi.
Gratidão..imensa!!
Parabéns , belíssimo trabalho.
Internet: builds stuff with ramen noodles

Bendiciones 🙏🌲🌷
I love how she works really hard and then the old woman who she lives with comes in at the end to help eat, teach, or use whatever is prepared. I wanna live there
I think this was one of the first videos i watched..



It was a long journey
That plant is a bless, specially for DIYers. We wish Bamboo grew all around the world. 👍😎
Too good.very creative
Is it just me thinking how nice the colour grading in the video is? Okay.
I’m just amazed how she can carry all that bamboo! I could never-
AMAZING! not a single screw or nail used. Nicely done and pretty as well. You make it seem effortless. 💝
哎呀嘛，她怎么什么都會呀，我的女神。
你太厲害了，哇-！！太…牛叉了-！！
Seriously I could just watch her all day, skilled and beautiful.
This beautiful 🤩 young lady has some serious carpentry skills...Lovely too watch her use some ancient Chinese carpentry methods to build those fantastic looking furniture items. May you live a long life and prosper in your heritage....
Какая умница, как этому всему можно было научиться? Все делает уверенно, четко! Поразительно!
I am Indian  I like  your  home  nature  so butiful
柒姑娘好厲害，廚藝竹藝，樣樣精通，獨一無二。
You are the best youtuber in the world
I wonder what kind of person would dislike such a great video.
This lady should be the UN Ambassador of Sustainable Development.
Boa noite, Você é muito linda e muito talentosa... 🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏
I find no words...
Only: Respect...
I love how she works really hard and then the old woman who she lives with comes in at the end to help eat, teach, or use whatever is prepared. I wanna live there
Thank you. You made the whole process look so delicate and beautiful. The music is also perfect. I loved it.
柒姐加油！希望再看到你新的视频！
Que dom😍
just got the first dose of vaccine and 58 million views almost the entire half of our populations, you already have the majority Liziqi
Вот он талантливая, мастерица на все руки , творческий подход ко всему .
Какая ты молодец 👍, просто рукодельница
Quoted from an interview with the presenter. 
Ask Li Ziqi about bamboo, he will explain the kinds of bamboo and explain about bamboo in detail.
Because Li Ziqi is professor of bamboo.
Love from Kerala ❤️
She owes this to her grandpa. She must have been remembering him while making this furniture. Don't you think? 😇🥰
Your video is so beautiful.
Thank you for sharing your expert skills and beautiful furniture.
Это миловидная женщина является просто идеальной и талантливой от природы ,ещё и рукодельница которая для нас является просто идеалом создавая в доме рай и уют очень редко бывает . Желаю этой красивой и миловидной женщине счастья , любви и дальнейшего процветания . 👍👍👍🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻❤️❤️❤️🌺🌸🌹

I really like this
很治愈、有段时间睡觉前必须得看。不知道该怎么描述，看她的视频能让人放松，或是说放空。真不知道那些差评的你们是觉得哪里不好
Amazing.
Watching this makes me feel like us humans were supposed to live this way.

Any man that has a wife like this would be happy man
And here I am still trying put together this ikea piece
This is the type of activities that make me a fan of hers, making things out of nature.  Modern people  don't know how to survive in the wild anymore.
sooo im new to her channel, watched a couple of her vids but this one convinced me she’s a superwoman. if ever my boyfriend cheats on me, honestly, i dont think i would mind if it’s her.
你可是太棒了！
You are wonderful, watching you gives me peace of mind I would like to have such a life

😍So very talented and intelligent woman.  I'm so  proud of you girl.... 😍😘😘
Not many people can appreciate living like this.i was born in a.rain Forest, this is how we made our beds
Jiejie carried all those bamboos alone, and made everything only in two consecutive days. Amazing
Goddess of the wood. Never have I seen someone so evolved
Very nice so beautiful i like so much.
Ziqi's home town (Sichuan province of China) is also home town of pandas. No wonder there are so many bamboos. 😊
Beautiful Footage 😍😍
We all have to agree that this is the best Chanel on YouTube... I'm mean...
She loves and respect NATURE. In return, a single tree gives her so many things🌝🌼
Absolutely genius 😱
So intelligent 😀
I really want to see liziqi's garden ❤️❤️

WOW soooo talented
I love how she did not use metal nails in the furniture.
I'm fall in love with everything she do😍
在製作過程中可瞭解到竹子的特性呢，且取之於大地，待物命結束時也能回歸自然，👍。
I am from Bangladesh. I have seen your couple of video which was very interesting.

How smart she is & so talented ever👍👍👍😍😍😍
The most hard working girl, who have skills in broad range of activities, I've ever seen 👍🏻
This is just the female chinese version of Primitive Technology
I looove mugwort tea! Didn't know it could be used as pillow stuffing
Nice your work
I don't know how I got here but it's pure eye candy, video is nice and crisp too.

I was thinking in my head no way that's staying together without nuts and bolts. She uses nails made out of bamboo 🤯
Amazing 👏👏
Хорошая, трудолюбивая девушка из дружественного Вьетнама. Женившись на такой, горя знать не будешь.
So cute
She does it all. Impressive.
انا من العراق واحب هاذي الفتاة تحية طيبة من العراق
I wonder how many cuts she's suffered through her lifetime to reach such level of patience and artistry
I'm impressed that she doesn't use a single nail♥️
This is so beautiful
Multitalent 😘😘😘
thank you so much for inspiring me to work with the black bamboo i care for.
Love from Sri Lanka❤️🇱🇰
Finally some good content, YT algorithm.

Im very amazed at your strength and skills omg.
She is amazing ..😍
So she makes an entire living room set for her home. Meanwhile, I can't be bothered to throw the single load of wash I did today into the dryer..

Love the sound of the crickets at night ❤️❤️❤️
Нет слов!!!
شكرا. لقد استمتعت
She is working all the time .Great respect .Good bless you.
Beauty with brain❤️
5:52 Do you know why she's "touching" her head? She is rubbing her hair with the needle, so the needle gets lubricated by hair oil. Very traditional way of doing it! I've seen my mother doing this way when I was very young

Is there something this girl can't do 😭
一个视频做了两天三夜，想了四种思路换了五种文案，经过六次重写七推八敲九回修改，十分艰难

She can be an actress so beautiful 👍👍😍😘😘
The pencil behind the ear must be a universal carpentry thing.
Por favor coloquem legendas em inglês e ou espanhol para que um número muito maior de pessoas possa apreciar melhor seu trabalho👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏😟😟😟😟😟😟😟😟😟
Como assim? Chocada com o ser humano ... uma artesã cheia d talentos como a Liziqi, q construiu tudo isto com esforço e mérito próprio d um simples bambú ... ficou um trabalho magnífico, mas n agradaram 25 mil pessoas q simplesmente descurtiram ... eu sinto é muita pena destas pessoas invejosas e mal amadas  ... parabéns pelo trabalho maravilhoso Liziqi 
❤️🇧🇷❤️
Super like ❤️❤️❤️
Admiro mucho tu gran esfuerzo que realmente hacés en tu vida...muchas felicidades hermosa
Люблю вас.
Wow... She just made a set of beautiful furniture in no time and in very skillful manner. I would have probably already died on the way to the forest to get the bamboo, mauled by a pissed off panda or something.
This is literally how Chinese people lived back in the past, as technology improves, less people live like this. it's amazing that a women like her still continues to do things the traditional way, it reminds me of the past. You can tell from traditional old Chinese buildings, it's amazing, all hand-made, people back then are so damn smart. Now people all uses machines for everything, and yes it's efficient, but it feels different.
Her and her grandma deserve all the happiness and blessings in the world
Gila keren bgt, strong woman
Parabéns sua arte é linda e sua força são impressionante . 
Artista e guerreira .
Your so talented and beautiful ❤️😍❤️sissy
This girl: can build furniture from bamboo
me: struggles to aasemble a chair from ikea
deve ser cansativo demais, porém, deve ser tão bom morar assim no meio da natureza, repleta de animais. queria muito, aliás, ela é a total patroa.
I really looove and enjoy your inspirational videos Liziqi :) THANK YOU! The best for you and yours :)
Amazing
Perfeito,adoro os vídeos dela!!!
So easy to watch but very hard in actual work. . . .
Those 10k dislikers are those who are jealous of you
Vc está em um nível superior a nós em todos os sentidos!
There are no words to express my feelings right now. She is a superhuman.
Very cool natural bed.
Self mastery's is beautiful.
You do the all work very super
that is a lot of hardwork😭😭😭respect for you maam
Рос бы у нас тоже бамбук, много чего из него можно сделать
I don’t get why there are disliking.... I mean I can’t even carry one bamboo 😩, and I bet the people who dislike it can’t either 🙄.
Amazing skil👍👍
Fantastisch
Amazing
👌💚❤️
Cam on moi nguoi đa quan tan em yeu y cua em .cua anh .cua chau luon ha ha ha
There's something in her videos that makes you want to watch more. And I can't explain what.
ну какая же рукодельница но почему нет мужа ?все сама и сама
😍😍😍😍😍💖
Quá đỉnh luôn
Захотелось посмотреть китайскую историческую дораму
She looks like a freaking princess. A hardworking one. Wow.
당신을 화나게하거나 괴롭히는 사람들에게 귀찮게하지 마세요. 자신을 믿으세요. 저는 당신을 너무 사랑하고 당신의 팬 중 하나입니다.
മുള കൊണ്ടുള്ള കട്ടിലും ടി പോയി ഒരുപാട് ഇഷ്ടമായി 👍
her little "ha ha" when she stood on the furniture was so cute lol
Admiro completamente tus habilidades , me resulta fascinante el vasto conocimiento q' desarrollas  en tus vídeos ! Increíble
終於知道古人以何高超工藝技巧做出這麼多精美器物，謝謝子柒的示範。
Amazing
Mind boggling!Is there no end to her talents!She does everything so effortlessly. 🙏👍
You are one of brriliante girl keep it up
Watching this makes me think: What am I doing with my life?
I put off cleaning my shower for like 5 days coz I can’t be assed, meanwhile she has built a houseful of furniture, formented enough food to last a year and cooked 100 amazing meals from scratch. She is my hero ❤️
lights, camera, action and no talk just work. It always works with the Organic Lady, Kudos to all the team members for giving us a life lesson to live with nature in harmony.
I love of all Liziqi's videos! She is a true Spirited and Hardworking young woman. In fact, six months ago I was all over the internet looking for 'Life Skills Simple Life' for a character I am writing about and instantly it recommended me to 李子柒 Liziqi and
 我们的小喜 XiaoXi's Culinary Idyll. I follow both of them and thanks to their vast knowledge I have more understanding about Chinese tradition among other life skills. I have found myself now growing my own veggie garden (small apartment), I am trying out Shu embroidery, and building my own furniture (FB Marketplace old items to reusable) and decorating my place. Yea! I don't have bamboo in my backyard but I make them as I go, and all this thanks to Liziqi and XiaoXi! 😊 🧡 🧡 🧡
I love ur  video's and ur life also, can i visit ur place one day
真是太厲害了佩服佩服 但是 影片中的您可能花了10年以上的功夫 我們身在台灣 好的竹子也越來越少 像這種竹子加工 幾乎快要失傳了 沒有人重視 僅存的師父 都是以男性為主的七八十歲老師傅 竹子加工很 容易受傷 根本沒有人願意學 這段影片中的 作品 極為優秀 令我有很深的感觸
This is one of my favorite video's ever made! Thank you so much for making such a amazingly beautiful video!
Again amazing this is one of my favorite videos... You're a remarkable young woman and your grandmother's blessed to have you as you were blessed to have her and your grandpa.. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️😀👍
能否告知竹床凳的尺寸，我回江西的时候一定要照着一个，夏日放在后院乘凉。非常惬意
You are such an amazing lady!  I love to watch your video!  Thank you for sharing.  It would be nice to have some subtitle in English!

Люблю наблюдать за этой девушкой, твёрдый характер, трудолюбивая восторгаюсь ею и учусь у неё 👍
Such a simple tranquility on full display! If only I may someone become a fraction as creative as is Liziqi, then I too may enjoy a full life. Thank You for Sharing ...

Could you imagine this goddess on survivor
21,000+ people disliked this. Excuse me, what? It's literally a person making a sofa out of bamboo.
I like the quickness of the place and I love the flowers and trees

I'm about to turn 60. And I finally figured out, I want to be just like her.
You are amazing. I learned so much just by watching you. I wished there are more English subtitles. Thx for beautiful and peaceful videos. 😇🙏🙏🙏
This young woman is an extraordinary beauty and amazingly talented. I have been watching everyone of her videos,  I truly appreciate how she gave up everything in city life, by moved to live and taking care of her elderly grandmother.
What a lovely woman ♀️ n everything.
She is very creative with nature if we are a creative person like her we don't need to buy things much
要注意安全！最好带个手套，毕竟是女孩子！
這視頻拍得好唯美，剪輯搭上配樂，有一氣呵成的感覺！人長得漂亮、個嬌小、手又巧，像極了金庸筆下的黃蓉～
PARABÉNS sensacional lindíssima casa

Who else has watched this video multiple times?
A lot of respects to Liziqui ❤
Wow liziqi sooo beautiful ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
That is one smart, tough, wonderful, and beautiful young lady.  I gave up my man-card to her a long time ago, when I watched her make an awesome outdoor swing/lounge/love seat/bed. :-)  Those are some really nice furniture pieces! I want to take a nap on the lounge so bad... :-)  Thank you, 李子柒, so much for your wonderful videos. Best wishes.
I can't believe what I am seeing. This girl is incredible.
And all this for share a cup of tea with Grandma...great!!!

Hard working woman and clearly extremely smart- beautiful
I heard from her older fans that before she did these type of calm-country-life videos she made woodworking/handicraft tutorial videos and honestly I belive them
She works always like a non-stop machine ....🥰💚 Nd to see her videos I realize that how much lazy I am!!🙁
Example if she will marry she would all the stuff and decorations 😉😘❤️😂
原来大家都喜欢反复看制作竹家具视频啊😄
Excellent liziqi
She makes me wanna be...productive

Alucinante!!!💞
Que lindo como trabaja impresionante.
From iraq, god bless u
Во всех роликах СУМАСШЕДШАЯ работа оператора!!! Смотритса на одном дыхании! Отличная аппаратура, цвета, сюжет, постановка кадра. БРАВО!!! Про героиню вообще молчу. Звезда! Главное, чтобы журналюги не добрались до неё, а то все испоганят.
i like your vedios but can you please stop cutting trees...thanks
I'll have exam this morning  yet watching some bamboo sofa making at 2 AM =/
Those who dislike this video admits that they themselves can't do this. I? I believe one can do this. She's that good with woodcraft. And I loved her carpentry. 💪💪
i wish i was just as talented as her, she’s so amaaazing omg
First impressions I watching this video by Liziqi on Tiktok, and I think, she look like beauty doll but she's so creative. Very inspiring. I think i must going to subscribe
This is amazing and her talent takes me on to another level. Do we have humans like this still in existinance. I rest my case 💕 and feel embarrassed of myself . This talent and hard work somehow needs to be passed on to our lazy south africans
يلي شي بياخد العقل
you deserve million subscribers.. 😘 love from malaysia..
Hola Liziqi... Saludos desde Xalapa, Veracruz, México...
Love your work you are so active in your all activities...you are best cook and good farmer too...so hardwork...i wish i want to spend time with you and beautiful atmosphere

給婆婆做把能靠背的椅子！
This made me miss those days living in a peaceful rural area
It might be related to a controversy a while ago relating to the chinese cultural appropriation of the korean dish "kimchi".

Okay YouTube recommend. You did good this time. This was a great watch
ماشاء الله اكثر من رائع .. نسائنا مبدعات في الطلبات فقط
If you are new here, here is absolutely everything you need to know about Liziqi ( Li Ziyi ): 
 
In 1990, Li Ziyi fell to the ground in Mianyang, Sichuan. Her parents divorced when she was very young. Later, her father died, and Li Ziyi became an orphan. His stepmother didn’t treat her well. Li Zizhen mentioned on Weibo that he had had a half-dead experience when his stepmother dragged her hair into the gutter and was beaten.
 
Grandpa and Grandma distressed granddaughter, and finally decided to take Li Ziyu home and live. When Li Ziyi was in fifth grade, his grandfather died again, and it was difficult for his grandma to raise her to continue school. At the age of 14, Li Ziyi had to drop out of school and go to the city alone to work hard, and began an 8-year wandering life. Her first life was very hard. She slept in a park chair and scratched her head for two months.
 
Li Ziyi has also worked as a waiter in a hotel, with a monthly salary of 300 yuan. In order to earn more income, she went to learn to play discs and sang in the bar. Later, when talking about the matter, Li Zizhen frankly said: “I didn’t say that I liked music at that time, just to live, I felt that it was well paid.”
 
In 2012, because grandma was ill once, Li Ziyi was worried that she would regret it later, throwing away all work and returning to grandma. “Being closer, I feel more at ease.”
 
After returning, Li Ziyi opened a Taobao shop, but the business has been up and running, and he barely eats. In 2015, under the influence of his younger brother, Li Ziyi was exposed to the short video platform Meipai. Until 2016, seeing that his younger brother had some fans on Meipai, and holding more fans can improve the mentality of Taobao business, Li Ziyi re-entered Meipai to prepare for his own video program.
 
The reason why she chose to shoot videos in this style is closely related to her childhood environment.
 
In an interview with the living room of Sina Club, Li Ziyi mentioned, “All these things that are self-sufficient in the countryside, for me, they are jealous. In the short video, she chose to start from the most familiar places.
 
In the beginning, Li Ziyi gave himself a topic called “Four Seasons Change, Eat While You Eat”. After the suggestion of Meipai editor, it became “Ancient Food” and it is still used today.
 
In September 2016, a new opportunity came quietly, which also became an important promoter for Li Ziyu to get more attention in the future. Sina Weibo began to openly search for more outstanding short video creators for resource support.
 
As mentioned at the beginning of the article, Liu Tongming brought her Weibo resources support.
 
One day in September 2016, Li Feng, an ancient short video blogger, accidentally received a private Weibo message from “Mr. L”. Mr. L expressed his love for Li Ziyu’s video content, felt that he had fulfilled his Taoyuan dream, and hoped to meet her.
 
For a long time after that, Li Ziyi received Mr. L’s private letter. “It would be a shame for such a good video to let this person see it. This is usChina’s proud traditional culture should be seen by people in China and around the world. “Mr. L said in a private message.
 
At first, after seeing these private messages, Li Ziyi didn’t care too much, even worrying about encountering a liar. Until one day, Mr. L came to the city where Li Zizhen was, and wanted to ask her to have a meal and talk. Mr. L’s politeness and clear logical thinking made Li slowly drop his initial alert.
 
This accidental meeting has completely changed the life trajectory of Li Zizhen. Not long after the meal was over, with the help of Mr. L, Li Zizheng was supported by a large wave of resources on Sina Weibo, accelerating her popularity and allowing Li Zizhen to rush into the queue of the net influencer on the head.
 
This experience is partly recorded in a diary of Li Zizheng that year. Some insiders close to the senior executives of Weinian Technology confirmed to Tencent’s “Shenwang” that the “Mr. L” is actually Liu Tongming, and his pseudonym was publicly reported. Daxiong Liu, the founder of Wei Nian Technology, an MCN company to which Li Zizhen now belongs.
 
On December 8th, the reading volume of a Weibo topic labeled “Is Li Ziyi a cultural output” climbed to 800 million. Li Zizheng was once again on the hot search list.
 
The video created by Li Ziyi and her has become a phenomenon worthy of study now.
 
Extensive overseas communication is an important reason for Li Zihuan’s renewed attention. Some people say that she has filmed a desirable rural life and spread the charm of traditional Chinese culture and cuisine. Others think that her video is not completely true To reflect China’s rural life.
 
Even the queries that have been popular since the explosion have been brought up again, such as being a DJ, being a rich second generation, whether the video is from my own hands, is there a strong push behind it, and the video is true for rural life It’s still just a fiction for character setting.
 
An insider of Weinian Technology told Tencent’s “Deep Web” that Li Ziyi was of ordinary origin, and the relevant video content was produced by Li Ziyi himself. The popularity was not the initiative of the company and himself. In fact, both Li Zihuan and the micro-reading team behind him were quite low-key, and they were very enthusiastic and declined all the current interview needs.
 
Until August 17, 2018, Li Ziyi’s eponymous Tmall store officially opened. Six days after going online, the store with only five products at that time had sales of over 150,000 and sales of over 10 million. A year later, the total sales of 21 products displayed in the Li Zizhen flagship store exceeded 1.3 million, with total sales reaching 71 million.
The value behind Li Ziyi’s IP is being quickly tapped.
 
Li Ziyi started from scratch and gained the first fans with his own strength. But now the popularity and gains of fame and fortune are obviously no longer just her achievements.
According to Tianyan search, “Deep Web” shows that MCN Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co., Ltd., which Li Ziyi belongs to, was established on February 28, 2013, with a registered capital of RMB 5.208 million. According to the introduction, Wei Nian is an entertainment entertainment company that incubates KOL into IP through short videos and extends to consumer brands.
 
The information of Qixinbao shows that there are more than 100 pieces of intellectual property information of the trademark “Li Zihuan”. The applicant companies are Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co., Ltd. The product categories include food, clothing, shoes and hats, dyes and fats, beer and beverages, Financial property management, catering and accommodation.
 
Not only that, Wei Nian also has inextricable links with Li Ziyu’s companies.
 
According to the eye inspection, Li Jiajia (should be the original name of Li Ziyu) established Sichuan Ziyu Culture Communication Co., Ltd. on July 20, 2017, and Wei Nian is its shareholder, holding 51% of the shares. Supervisor, Li Jiajia holds 49% of the shares.
 
According to other data, there are as many as 50 beneficiary companies behind Hangzhou Weinian Technology Co., Ltd., including Greenland Holdings, ZTE, Xinhua Media, Vanke, Light Media, etc. .
Among the shareholders of Weinian Technology, Sina Weibo is particularly eye-catching.
 
From Wei Nian Technology to Sina Weibo, Li Ziyi gradually has the best cards that internet celebrities are looking forward to.
In her own words, she changed from “a little transparent to a person who is so useless to society”. After entering the public view and being noticed by more people, Li Ziyi’s sense of responsibility has also become heavier.
“I want to do what I can to do more things that are good for society, such as the spread of traditional culture, non-heritage cultural craftsmen, and I want to show these old things to everyone so that more people know. Li Ziyi said.

Far out. You make amazing furniture from bamboo and I have issues putting together a coffee table from Ikea -.-
40年前，我父母结婚的婚房，家里的木家具，床铺被褥全是父亲伯父和爷爷奶奶亲手制作的。感叹啊，现在长大了，家里经济上是也比以前富裕多了，但也同时失去了更宝贵的财富，因为祖辈的手艺在我们这代不能再传承下去了。
She is multi-talented
太优秀了
This girl is God gifted🥰🥰😇😇😇😇🙏🙏🙏
😍😍😍
I can hear Jackie Chan's voice saying

Very talented woman very strong... Godbless
She looks beautiful assembling a piece of furniture that she completely sourced from the forest.  Meanwhile I look like crap assembling pre-made furniture from Ikea.
বাঁশ দিয়ে এত সুন্দর ভাবে কাজ করা অনেক ভালো লাগলো শেয়ার করার জন্য ধন্যবাদ
She is amazing? So strong for a women😘😘😘😘😘
My dad saw this and was so excited.
He was born in Hunan China in 1932, a province next to where this girl lives.  
He couldn't believe this "little girl" made furniture that he remembers sleeping on during summer to escape the heat when he was a child.
He was impressed that she made it with he same finesse as the "old masters" did when he saw them do the work.
He left home before he turned into an adult to fight the communist and lived most of his life in Taiwan as an R.O.C. veteran/Teacher, and he hasn't seen furniture like this, made in such a way, since he left his childhood home

So... this is legit!!!
Amaziiiiiiing guys 😍😍
天下无难事只怕有心人啊
고수의 향기가 느껴지네요~

Success a great woman 😍😍

It's mesmerizing to watch her confident skill, knowledge of materials, industriousness, artistic sensibility, versatility & imagination.
She sets the high standard for being a person of substance & virtue. We can all learn a great deal from her by the pleasure she derives from simplicity & the fruits of her own labors.
I, for one, am rethinking my own value system.
People wonder why Panda is only in China, but if I were a Panda, I wouldn't want to leave this heaven.

Te sigo viendo hermosa
Honestly, this was one of the best videos I have ever watched. I was entertained, felt pride and happiness for her, and sadness that more people do not have the drive and skill to do what she h has done and can do. Much respect to you........
This proves human brain is all above knowledge
Amazing talented work that should be continually passed down to future generations, so that the beauty and skills of this art are NEVER lost with time. That was a lot of hard work, but truly a stunning outcome.
Something about this feels so unreal. From the music, the ASMR sounds, and the scenic environment. It’s so magical. ✨

I could watch this all day. 😌
I love to watch you at work, you’re amazing, and so creative, artistic, intelligent and a strong person for doing all that you do daily and still so calm, and taking care of your Grandma, also making sure you prepare meals for her too .  I find that I can be able to not stress and relax, reminds me of my country life...which I left 40 years ago., but all the more interesting to see how much you can do.
Superb
This is absolutely amazing she’s so full of energy she’s beautiful I love how she lives her grandma is adorable I just stumbled across this yesterday and I am a subscriber now and I can’t stop watching...He is absolutely unbelievably amazing I don’t even have to know her language to be intrigued to watch And what’s crazy is people paid thousands upon thousands of dollars for stuff like this definitely an inspiration and strong as hell I might add💯💯💯❤️❤️❤️🥰
awesome
She's such an admirable person. The way she uses nature in her everyday life is beautiful.
I'll just go ahead and say it; I am so in love with this woman. Is it all legit or a bit fake?! I don't care. Sometimes one just has to take something at face value and enjoy it for what it is. In her videos I see the way we are supposed to live.
Simply astonishing in every sense of the word. The skills that this young woman has is inspiring. The furniture that she has made with her own hands using hand tools and no hardware, the simple beauty of the finished product is just amazing. Wow.
子七是真的不错、优秀
We should have more strong and respectful female figures on YouTube like her.
😍😍😍
Какое огромное эстетическое удовольствие я получил от просмотра 
Девушка потрясающая, красавица с руками.
She is truly talented  and amazing that she works alone with such patience and love for nature. The nature understand and have a spirit that help her to be one with nature.
You never cease to amaze me. I love your videos and they help with the stress a lot. I wish the captions on YouTube would work a bit more properly, or just learn the language. Point is, you're amazing. Please keep doing more videos and take care of yourself and granny.  😊
Best 🙏🏻
Garota você é fantástica!!!! Sou sua fã. Muita saúde sempre.  É😍
Syaratnya bisa pengrajin Bambu adalah pengrajin rotan..

This is so beautiful, as is everything you touch! You have such a gift, with plants and with people. So much love inside of your soul.  You truly take away my anxiety when I watch your videos. I appreciate the calmness and feeling at one with nature.  Your videos provide that to us all.  🙏🏻❤️🌈
Always such a pleasure to watch you. I get so excited when you upload. I applaud you for all the work you do. You are such a inspiration! You truly are a blessing for all of us. You make us all women proud! LOVE YOU and wish you ALL the very best! Please keep making such beautiful videos <3
this is real hardwork
❤️❤️👌👌
很多人想过的日子………
You such a strong Wonderwoman
Xinh ghê ấy
I am so glad I stopped to watch this.  Makers are truly the same all over the world: their imagination, perseverance and craftsmanship is so satisfying to watch (and the filmmaking and storytelling is also superb).  Bamboo looks like such an amazing material - I wish I had a forest to gather my materials from.  The only place I could ever find it when I was young was behind the carpet stores (the carpet was rolled on bamboo).  Today they just use paper or plastic or metal - I don’t know where one would find large bamboo in America for a project like this.  I did not know it could be heat-bent - something new I learned from this video.  And my many thanks for the kind soul who provided the translation.  I will surely smile every time I remember this video.
I'm in awe
😍😍😍
You're the best j e
,💔💖
May I stay 2 weeks in Liziqi's house and village?
RESPECT ✊🏻🖤 

Also I think it’s literally the first time in ages YouTube recommended something Actually good to me.
นี่คือครั้งแรกที่ฉันได้เห็นคุณในยูทูป และฉันก็หลงรักทันที☺️💚
这是我第一次在YouTube上看到你，我立即坠入爱河。💚☺️
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT  MEAN THE '柒'IS FIREWOOD,RICE.OIL.SALT.GINGER.VINEGAR.TEA.
Huzur🌹🌹🌹
how can she knows everything!
She's so beautiful... And the fact that she made all that out of nature makes her even more extraordinary... I often think how this world is big and there's so many humans mostly average... While there's amazing people in far distant lands... I dunno what trying to say... But shes just truly extraordinary
It is embarrassing all the things she can do. Meanwhile we keep teaching useless things to kids in school. Our grand-parents didn't have our modern ways of communication and knew little about the world around them but all the things they knew were essentials. When this bubble bursts it will be time to reset.
Amazing woman!!!
She is the REAL example of Proverbs chapter 31 in the Bible...
Wow!!!!!!
My brain: now ive learnt， i want it!
My hands: no you dont.
So happy to find this channel and series. I can't help but to be reminded that this world truly is magical! And full of beautiful people from all over. Cheers to All! Be Safe and be kind to each other <3
Just wow... I have no words to explain how talented you are... You are the inspiration for every lady.. You teach me that woman can do everything and we are not weak.. Love from India ❤️

❤️
Incredibly amazing woman! God is surely happy of your talents Liziqi... You're my Fav....

Excellent usage of our natural resources. Use of pegs and the preciseness with which she has made this sofa is praiseworthy!
I watch this as preparation for Animal Crossing

She is a brilliant girl. She has done everything in the easy way.
Просто гениально! Очень круто!👍🏻
❤️
she is the most talented person i have ever watched on this platform. 👏
👍👍👍👍👍
These types of craftsmanship is the 9th wonder of the world...
Whatever automation comes in future., But can't be compared to this type of human work....
Respect from India....👌👍👌👌👍👌👍👌👍
I remember my childhood to her pitching water using bamboo,caring woods in your back or shoulder.. i wish i watch this since then because its very educational and realistic ..thank you i wanna do everything i watched when i go back to my country and share my knowledge with my beloved husband because he is a farmer and i learned a lot from him too..keep safe and long life to your grandma..
She should come together with al these people who make the underground pools with sticks and build and entire country
😍😍😍
remarkable
❤️
You are intelligent and extraordinary..Love from Bangladesh
Ilike to see working with the bambo
I think the thing i like the most about u is not that u can make a million things out of nothing...or your willingness to live a simple lifestyle in the countryside... But rather the love you have for your granny. That is a priceless trait.
Chinese should preserve their traditional way of making stuff like this.
Living in such a beautiful place

Feels like I'm looking into the life of a background character from Final Fantasy or something. This is great
I have to agree that the maker of the video is also as skillful in his field as the young lady. Many thanks for allowing us to have such great moments watching both talents.
中国人真的很努力，也很甜美🥰😇

She need to come here and teach Natural Engineering 101. I would definitely take her classes.
She is a strong,  independent women who don't need no feminism.
Moral of the story: Get yourself a girl who can make a bench
Q lindo lugar. Y q capacidad de hacer los muebles. Te felicito por tus capacidades. Saludos chile
I LOVE IT WHEN SHE MAKES STUFF OUT OF BAMBOO!
From where you did learned so much?
Have a wonderful moments on your own created sofas Liziqi , You and your grandma are adorable :)  💖
❣️❣️
Nobody: 
YouTube recommendations: Lmao you wanna see how to build a bamboo sofa ?
If bamboo grew around here, this is literally the type of thing I'd do all day, trees houses would have been definitely easier and more fun
More than talented and creative, I really have enjoyed watching her handcrafte and handling bamboo, and finally the outcome is amazing 👏 ...
Thoi ta tha cho ba mot lanh nho cai cua minh do .
Amei. Mas podia fazer mostrando o passo a passo.
❤
How can anyone dislike her videos like seriously???
子柒太有才，又心藏山林溪谷，诗情画意。好一难得的秀外慧中佳人。
Comment un tout petit bout de femme comme vous pouvez avoir une force extraordinaire !!! Vous êtes vraiment surprenante
حلو  🧡🧡🧡🧡
im thinking of making  a bed frame with bamboo. i wanna make the way you make it. without machinery. all by hand. if only everyone could live like this, having to make everything on your own. instead of going to the grocery store for veggies for example you grow them. it the work that makes it rewarding and understanding what life was like back then  before us. im so proud of you, it so hard i know, but it amazing seeing what goes on to give your family comfort, food, clothes, but more importantly doing this because you want to. remember, only do what you feel is happy for yourself and insure you can eat, drink, rest especially, but also have time for yourself.  Make sure you care for yourself, do not over do it, it will affect your health.
Very nice
shame on those who think ikea furniture is "too much work"
Рrobably for the 100th time, I am watching this video and
for the 100th time Liziqi surprises me.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
